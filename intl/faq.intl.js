In addition, blocks are slightly bigger in Scratch 3.0 to help address issues we observed with new users having trouble clicking and dragging small interface elements.","faq.extensionsScratch3Title":"Where did the Pen blocks go? Where did the Music blocks go? Where did the Video Sensing blocks go?","faq.extensionsScratch3Body":"The Pen, Music, and Video Sensing blocks have been moved into extensions.

More tutorials will be added soon (such as \"Pong Game\" and \"Make It Fly\").","faq.remixDefinitionTitle":"What is a remix?","faq.remixDefinitionBody":"When a Scratcher makes a copy of someone else’s project and modifies it to add their own ideas (for example, by changing scripts or costumes), the resulting project is called a \"remix\". Every project shared to the Scratch website can be remixed. We consider even a minor change to be a valid remix, as long as credit is given to the original project creator and others who made significant contributions to the remix.","faq.remixableTitle":"Why does the Scratch Team require that all projects be “remixable”?","faq.remixableBody":"We believe that remixing other people’s projects is a great way to learn to program and to create interesting projects. Through remixing, creative ideas spread through the Scratch community, and everyone benefits. All projects shared on the Scratch website are covered by the “Creative Commons Share Alike” license, which means that you can remix any project you see on the Scratch website -- and everyone else can remix any of the projects that you share on the website.","faq.creativeCommonsTitle":"What if I don’t want others to remix my projects?","faq.creativeCommonsBody":"Remixing is an important part of the Scratch community. If you don’t want others to view or remix your creations, you can still create projects on the Scratch website, but don’t share them on the website.","faq.fairUseTitle":"Can I use images / sounds / media from the internet in my projects?","faq.fairUseBody":"If you choose to integrate someone else’s work into your own, be sure to give them credit on the project “credits” section, and include a link back to the original. To find art / sounds that are already licensed for remixing, check out the {ccLink}.","faq.ccLinkText":"Creative Commons search page","faq.whyAccountTitle":"Why is it useful to have a Scratch account?","faq.whyAccountBody":"Even without an account, you can play other people’s projects, read comments and forums, and even create your own projects. But you need an account to save and share projects, write comments and forum posts, and participate in other \"social\" activities in the community (like \"loving\" other people’s projects).","faq.createAccountTitle":"How can I create an account?","faq.createAccountBody":"Just click \"Join\" on the Scratch home page. You’ll need to respond to a few questions, and provide an email address. It takes just a couple minutes, and it’s totally free!","faq.checkConfirmedTitle":"How can I check whether my account has been confirmed?","faq.howToConfirmTitle":"How do I confirm my account?","faq.howToConfirmBody":"After you create a new account on Scratch, you’ll receive an email message with a link. Just click the link to confirm your account. Once you confirm your account, you’ll be able to share projects, write comments, and create studios. Confirming your account also lets you receive email updates from the Scratch Team. If you cannot find the email with the confirmation link, check your Spam folder. If you still can’t find it, and want to receive another copy, go to your Account Settings, click the Email tab, and follow the instructions there. Please note that it may take up to an hour for the email to arrive. If you still don't see the email after an hour, {contactLink}.","faq.contactLinkText":"let us know","faq.checkConfirmedBody":"To check whether your account is confirmed, login to your Scratch account and go to your {settingsLink} page. Confirmed email addresses will show a small green checkmark. Otherwise, you will see the text \"Your email address is unconfirmed\" in orange.","faq.settingsLinkText":"Email Settings","faq.requireConfirmTitle":"Do I have to confirm my account?","faq.requireConfirmBody":"You can still use many aspects of Scratch without confirming your account, including creating and saving projects (without sharing them).","faq.forgotPasswordTitle":"I forgot my username or password. How can I reset it?","faq.forgotPasswordBody":"Enter your username or email address on the {resetLink} page. The website will send an email to the address associated with your username and a link you can use to reset your password.","faq.resetLinkText":"Password Reset","faq.changePasswordTitle":"How do I change my password?","faq.changePasswordBody":"Login to your Scratch account, then visit our {changeLink} page where you can change your password.","faq.changeLinkText":"Password Settings","faq.changeEmailTitle":"How do I change my email address?","faq.changeEmailBody":"Login to your Scratch account, then visit our {changeEmailLink} page where you can change your email address.","faq.newScratcherTitle":"How do I transition from 'New Scratcher' to 'Scratcher'?","faq.newScratcherBody":"When you create an account, you’ll be labelled as a “New Scratcher.” To make the transition to \"Scratcher\", you should make and share projects, comment helpfully on other Scratchers’ projects, and be patient! After you’ve met the requirements, a link will appear on your profile page inviting you to become a Scratcher, and you’ll have some additional capabilities on the Scratch website. (Note that we don't promote New Scratchers to Scratcher on request )","faq.multipleAccountTitle":"Can I have more than one account?","faq.multipleAccountBody":"It's fine to have a few accounts on the Scratch website, as long as none of them are used to break the {cgLink}. In that case, all related accounts may be blocked or deleted.","faq.multipleLoginTitle":"Is it OK to have more than one person logged into an account?","faq.multipleLoginBody":"This is not allowed because the website and project editor can easily get confused when more than one person is logged in to the same account. When an account does something that violates the {cgLink}, all related accounts may be blocked or deleted. If you share an account with someone who does something bad with it, this means your accounts can be blocked for what the other person did.","faq.changeUsernameTitle":"Can I change my username?","faq.changeUsernameBody":"The structure of the Scratch website depends on having a consistent account name, so it’s not possible to change your username. If you really need to switch to a new username, you can make a new account, but you'll have to copy your projects over to the new account on your own.","faq.shareInfoTitle":"What information can I share on / with my account?","faq.shareInfoBody":"Please don’t share personal contact information, such as your physical address, email, phone number, or anything else that can be used to make contact outside of the Scratch website. Please report projects, comments, or forum posts that contain this kind of information, so the Scratch Team can remove the information, and remind the author of our policy against sharing personal contact information.","faq.deleteAccountTitle":"How do I delete my account?","faq.deleteAccountBody":"Login to Scratch, and then click your username in the top right-hand corner. Select \"Account Settings\", then click the \"I want to delete my account\" link at the bottom of the page. But you should only do this if you are absolutely sure that you want to delete your account.","faq.scratchFreeTitle":"Is Scratch free? Can I use it wherever I want?","faq.scratchFreeBody":"Yes! Scratch is available free of charge. You can use it in your school, and you can teach a course about it (even a course that costs money). You don't need to buy a license: it's free!","faq.scratchScreenshotTitle":"Can I use screenshots of Scratch in a book or presentation?","faq.scratchScreenshotBody":"Yes, you can use screenshots / images of the Scratch application and website in a book or presentation, and consider them to be licensed under the {licenseLink} license. We ask that you include a note somewhere in your materials  saying: \"Scratch is a project of the Scratch Foundation, in collaboration with the Lifelong Kindergarten Group at the MIT Media Lab. It is available for free at https://scratch.mit.edu\".","faq.licenseLinkText":"Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike","faq.scratchDescriptionTitle":"Can I include a description of Scratch in brochures or other materials?","faq.scratchDescriptionBody":"Sure! We recommend the following description: \"Scratch is a coding  language and online community where you can create your own interactive stories, games, and animations -- and share your creations with others around the world. As young people create and share Scratch projects, they learn to think creatively, reason systematically, and work collaboratively.

There are a few exceptions: the Scratch Logo, Scratch Cat, Gobo, Pico, Nano, Giga, and Tera are Scratch trademarks, and can not be used without explicit permission from the Scratch Team.","faq.sellProjectsTitle":"Can I sell my Scratch projects?","faq.sellProjectsBody":"Yes: Your Scratch project is your creation. But keep in mind that once you share your project on the Scratch website, everyone is free to download, remix, and reuse the project based on the terms of the {licenseLink} license. So if you intend to sell your project, you may want to un-share it from the Scratch website.","faq.sourceCodeTitle":"Where can I find the source code for Scratch?","faq.sourceCodeBody":"The source code for the Scratch programming editor can be found on {guiLink}.

There’s a link at the bottom of every page on Scratch.","faq.reportContentTitle":"What do I do if I see something that’s inappropriate?","faq.reportContentBody":"You can click the link that says \"report\" on any project, comment, discussion post, studio, or profile page where you see something that isn't ok for Scratch. If the situation is complicated, you can use the {contactLink} link (available at the bottom of every page) to explain. Be sure to include as much detail as you can, with links to relevant pages.","faq.noFlameTitle":"What do I do if I see someone being mean or disrespectful?","faq.noFlameBody":"Don’t add to the flames! Responding to mean comments with more mean comments just makes things worse, and could result in your account being blocked. Instead, simply report anything that is disrespectful or unconstructive, and we’ll follow up with the author.

What do I do?","faq.stolenAccountBody":"You are responsible for keeping your password secure. If someone you know took control of your account and did bad things, tell the adults in charge of the computer they used. If you think someone you don’t know has access to your account, change the password and / or use the {contactLink} link to explain the situation. If your account was blocked for doing something that you did which broke the Scratch {cgLink}, please don’t tell us that someone else did it. When people tell us someone else used their account to do something bad, we then need to try and talk to that person before we can restore the account. This means your account will just stay blocked for a lot longer than if you are honest with us about what happened.","faq.aboutExtensionsTitle":"What are extensions?","faq.aboutExtensionsBody":"In the Scratch editor, you can add collections of extra blocks called \"extensions.\" For example, there are extensions that enable you to program physical devices (such as micro:bit and LEGO robotics kits) and to translate text within your Scratch projects. We will continue to add new extensions over time, so what you can do with Scratch will continue to grow over time. ","faq.howToAddExtensionsTitle":"How do I add an extension to a project?","faq.howToAddExtensionsBody":"If you click on the \"Extensions\" button in the bottom left corner of the Scratch programming editor, you will see a listing of all Scratch Extensions.

You can add multiple extensions to the same project.","faq.createExtensionsTitle":"How do I create my own extension for Scratch","faq.createExtensionsBody":"The Scratch Team will be publishing specifications and guidelines for extensions in the future. Once available, you will be able to submit extensions to the Scratch Team for consideration in the official Scratch 3.0 extensions library. We’ll also provide guidelines for developing and distributing \"experimental\" extensions, which can be used to create projects on individual computers, but not shared in the Scratch online community.","faq.scratchXTitle":"What will happen to the ScratchX website?","faq.scratchXBody":"The ScratchX website (scratchx.org) was an experimental testbed for extensions. Extensions created for ScratchX are not compatible with Scratch 3.0. Once experimental extensions are fully supported in Scratch we will discontinue support for ScratchX and provide developers and users time to transition off of ScratchX to the new extensions platform.","faq.cloudDataInfoTitle":"What are cloud variables?","faq.cloudDataInfoBody":"Cloud variables allow for data from a project to be saved and shared with other people in the Scratch community.

If people \"see inside\" or remix your code, it creates a copy of the variable and does not affect or change the original variable.","faq.newScratcherCloudTitle":"I am logged in, but I cannot use projects with cloud variables What is going on?","faq.newScratcherCloudBody":"If you are still a \"New Scratcher\" on the website, you will not be able to use projects with cloud variables. You need to become a \"Scratcher\" to have access to cloud variables. See the Accounts section (above) for more information about the transition from “New Scratcher” to \"Scratcher\".","faq.multiplayerTitle":"Is it possible to make multiplayer games with cloud variables?","faq.multiplayerBody":"Multiplayer games may be difficult to create, due to network speed and synchronization issues.

All projects shared on the Scratch website are covered by the “Creative Commons Share Alike” license, which means that you can remix any project you see on the Scratch website -- and everyone else can remix any of the projects that you share on the website.","faq.creativeCommonsTitle":"What if I don’t want others to remix my projects?","faq.creativeCommonsBody":"Remixing is an important part of the Scratch community. If you don’t want others to view or remix your creations, you can still create projects on the Scratch website, but don’t share them on the website.","faq.fairUseTitle":"Can I use images / sounds / media from the internet in my projects?","faq.fairUseBody":"If you choose to integrate someone else’s work into your own, be sure to give them credit on the project “credits” section, and include a link back to the original. To find art / sounds that are already licensed for remixing, check out the {ccLink}.","faq.ccLinkText":"Creative Commons search page","faq.whyAccountTitle":"Why is it useful to have a Scratch account?","faq.whyAccountBody":"Even without an account, you can play other people’s projects, read comments and forums, and even create your own projects. But you need an account to save and share projects, write comments and forum posts, and participate in other \"social\" activities in the community (like \"loving\" other people’s projects).","faq.createAccountTitle":"How can I create an account?","faq.createAccountBody":"Just click \"Join\" on the Scratch home page. You’ll need to respond to a few questions, and provide an email address. It takes just a couple minutes, and it’s totally free!","faq.checkConfirmedTitle":"How can I check whether my account has been confirmed?","faq.howToConfirmTitle":"How do I confirm my account?","faq.howToConfirmBody":"After you create a new account on Scratch, you’ll receive an email message with a link. Just click the link to confirm your account. Once you confirm your account, you’ll be able to share projects, write comments, and create studios. Confirming your account also lets you receive email updates from the Scratch Team. If you cannot find the email with the confirmation link, check your Spam folder. If you still can’t find it, and want to receive another copy, go to your Account Settings, click the Email tab, and follow the instructions there. Please note that it may take up to an hour for the email to arrive. If you still don't see the email after an hour, {contactLink}.","faq.contactLinkText":"let us know","faq.checkConfirmedBody":"To check whether your account is confirmed, login to your Scratch account and go to your {settingsLink} page. Confirmed email addresses will show a small green checkmark. Otherwise, you will see the text \"Your email address is unconfirmed\" in orange.","faq.settingsLinkText":"Email Settings","faq.requireConfirmTitle":"Do I have to confirm my account?","faq.requireConfirmBody":"You can still use many aspects of Scratch without confirming your account, including creating and saving projects (without sharing them).","faq.forgotPasswordTitle":"I forgot my username or password. How can I reset it?","faq.forgotPasswordBody":"Enter your username or email address on the {resetLink} page. The website will send an email to the address associated with your username and a link you can use to reset your password.","faq.resetLinkText":"Password Reset","faq.changePasswordTitle":"How do I change my password?","faq.changePasswordBody":"Login to your Scratch account, then visit our {changeLink} page where you can change your password.","faq.changeLinkText":"Password Settings","faq.changeEmailTitle":"How do I change my email address?","faq.changeEmailBody":"Login to your Scratch account, then visit our {changeEmailLink} page where you can change your email address.","faq.newScratcherTitle":"How do I transition from 'New Scratcher' to 'Scratcher'?","faq.newScratcherBody":"When you create an account, you’ll be labelled as a “New Scratcher.” To make the transition to \"Scratcher\", you should make and share projects, comment helpfully on other Scratchers’ projects, and be patient! After you’ve met the requirements, a link will appear on your profile page inviting you to become a Scratcher, and you’ll have some additional capabilities on the Scratch website. (Note that we don't promote New Scratchers to Scratcher on request )","faq.multipleAccountTitle":"Can I have more than one account?","faq.multipleAccountBody":"It's fine to have a few accounts on the Scratch website, as long as none of them are used to break the {cgLink}. In that case, all related accounts may be blocked or deleted.","faq.multipleLoginTitle":"Is it OK to have more than one person logged into an account?","faq.multipleLoginBody":"This is not allowed because the website and project editor can easily get confused when more than one person is logged in to the same account. When an account does something that violates the {cgLink}, all related accounts may be blocked or deleted. If you share an account with someone who does something bad with it, this means your accounts can be blocked for what the other person did.","faq.changeUsernameTitle":"Can I change my username?","faq.changeUsernameBody":"The structure of the Scratch website depends on having a consistent account name, so it’s not possible to change your username. If you really need to switch to a new username, you can make a new account, but you'll have to copy your projects over to the new account on your own.","faq.shareInfoTitle":"What information can I share on / with my account?","faq.shareInfoBody":"Please don’t share personal contact information, such as your physical address, email, phone number, or anything else that can be used to make contact outside of the Scratch website. Please report projects, comments, or forum posts that contain this kind of information, so the Scratch Team can remove the information, and remind the author of our policy against sharing personal contact information.","faq.deleteAccountTitle":"How do I delete my account?","faq.deleteAccountBody":"Login to Scratch, and then click your username in the top right-hand corner. Select \"Account Settings\", then click the \"I want to delete my account\" link at the bottom of the page. But you should only do this if you are absolutely sure that you want to delete your account.","faq.scratchFreeTitle":"Is Scratch free? Can I use it wherever I want?","faq.scratchFreeBody":"Yes! Scratch is available free of charge. You can use it in your school, and you can teach a course about it (even a course that costs money). You don't need to buy a license: it's free!","faq.scratchScreenshotTitle":"Can I use screenshots of Scratch in a book or presentation?","faq.scratchScreenshotBody":"Yes, you can use screenshots / images of the Scratch application and website in a book or presentation, and consider them to be licensed under the {licenseLink} license. We ask that you include a note somewhere in your materials  saying: \"Scratch is a project of the Scratch Foundation, in collaboration with the Lifelong Kindergarten Group at the MIT Media Lab. It is available for free at https://scratch.mit.edu\".","faq.licenseLinkText":"Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike","faq.scratchDescriptionTitle":"Can I include a description of Scratch in brochures or other materials?","faq.scratchDescriptionBody":"Sure! We recommend the following description: \"Scratch is a coding  language and online community where you can create your own interactive stories, games, and animations -- and share your creations with others around the world. As young people create and share Scratch projects, they learn to think creatively, reason systematically, and work collaboratively. Scratch is a project of the {sfLink} in collaboration with the Lifelong Kindergarten group at the MIT Media Lab. It is available for free at https://scratch.mit.edu\"","faq.presentScratchTitle":"Can I present Scratch at a conference?","faq.presentScratchBody":"Please feel free to make presentations about Scratch to educators or other groups.","faq.supportMaterialTitle":"May I use / remix Scratch support materials, sprites, images, sounds or sample projects I’ve found on the website?","faq.supportMaterialBody":"Yes: Most Scratch support materials on the Scratch website are available under the {licenseLink} license. There are a few exceptions: the Scratch Logo, Scratch Cat, Gobo, Pico, Nano, Giga, and Tera are Scratch trademarks, and can not be used without explicit permission from the Scratch Team.","faq.sellProjectsTitle":"Can I sell my Scratch projects?","faq.sellProjectsBody":"Yes: Your Scratch project is your creation. But keep in mind that once you share your project on the Scratch website, everyone is free to download, remix, and reuse the project based on the terms of the {licenseLink} license. So if you intend to sell your project, you may want to un-share it from the Scratch website.","faq.sourceCodeTitle":"Where can I find the source code for Scratch?","faq.sourceCodeBody":"The source code for the Scratch programming editor can be found on {guiLink}. The source code for {flashLink} and {scratch14Link}, are also available on GitHub.

There’s a link at the bottom of every page on Scratch.","faq.reportContentTitle":"What do I do if I see something that’s inappropriate?","faq.reportContentBody":"You can click the link that says \"report\" on any project, comment, discussion post, studio, or profile page where you see something that isn't ok for Scratch. If the situation is complicated, you can use the {contactLink} link (available at the bottom of every page) to explain. Be sure to include as much detail as you can, with links to relevant pages.","faq.noFlameTitle":"What do I do if I see someone being mean or disrespectful?","faq.noFlameBody":"Don’t add to the flames! Responding to mean comments with more mean comments just makes things worse, and could result in your account being blocked. Instead, simply report anything that is disrespectful or unconstructive, and we’ll follow up with the author. We check reports every day, multiple times per day - so rest assured, we'll sort things out.","faq.reviewContentTitle":"What does the Scratch team do when something is reported or flagged?","faq.reviewContentBody":"The Scratch Team reviews reported comments and projects every day. If something breaks the Scratch {cgLink}, we will remove it and send a warning to the account. We may also block the accounts or networks that were used to share it, depending on what was shared and if the person has been sent warnings before","faq.blockedAccountTitle":"What happens when an account is blocked?","faq.blockedAccountBody":"When an account is blocked, the owner can no longer access their account, use it to create projects, or post new comments. When they login, they see a page that explains why the account was blocked, along with a web form they can use to request to be unblocked. If the owner can show that they understand why their account was blocked, and promises to follow the Scratch {cgLink} in the future, they will be unblocked.","faq.stolenAccountTitle":"Someone got access to my account and got my account blocked. What do I do?","faq.stolenAccountBody":"You are responsible for keeping your password secure. If someone you know took control of your account and did bad things, tell the adults in charge of the computer they used. If you think someone you don’t know has access to your account, change the password and / or use the {contactLink} link to explain the situation. If your account was blocked for doing something that you did which broke the Scratch {cgLink}, please don’t tell us that someone else did it. When people tell us someone else used their account to do something bad, we then need to try and talk to that person before we can restore the account. This means your account will just stay blocked for a lot longer than if you are honest with us about what happened.","faq.aboutExtensionsTitle":"What are extensions?","faq.aboutExtensionsBody":"In the Scratch editor, you can add collections of extra blocks called \"extensions.\" For example, there are extensions that enable you to program physical devices (such as micro:bit and LEGO robotics kits) and to translate text within your Scratch projects. We will continue to add new extensions over time, so what you can do with Scratch will continue to grow over time. ","faq.howToAddExtensionsTitle":"How do I add an extension to a project?","faq.howToAddExtensionsBody":"If you click on the \"Extensions\" button in the bottom left corner of the Scratch programming editor, you will see a listing of all Scratch Extensions. When you select one of the extensions, a new category of blocks will be added to your project. The extension will be automatically loaded each time your project is opened. You can add multiple extensions to the same project.","faq.createExtensionsTitle":"How do I create my own extension for Scratch","faq.createExtensionsBody":"The Scratch Team will be publishing specifications and guidelines for extensions in the future. Once available, you will be able to submit extensions to the Scratch Team for consideration in the official Scratch 3.0 extensions library. We’ll also provide guidelines for developing and distributing \"experimental\" extensions, which can be used to create projects on individual computers, but not shared in the Scratch online community.","faq.scratchXTitle":"What will happen to the ScratchX website?","faq.scratchXBody":"The ScratchX website (scratchx.org) was an experimental testbed for extensions. Extensions created for ScratchX are not compatible with Scratch 3.0. Once experimental extensions are fully supported in Scratch we will discontinue support for ScratchX and provide developers and users time to transition off of ScratchX to the new extensions platform.","faq.cloudDataInfoTitle":"What are cloud variables?","faq.cloudDataInfoBody":"Cloud variables allow for data from a project to be saved and shared with other people in the Scratch community. You can use cloud variables to make surveys and other projects where others in the community to access and modify the data over time.","faq.makeCloudVarTitle":"How can I make a cloud variable?","faq.makeCloudVarBody":"Go to the \"Variables\" section of the blocks palette, select \"Make a Variable\", and then click the checkbox next to \"Cloud variable (stored on server)\".

If people \"see inside\" or remix your code, it creates a copy of the variable and does not affect or change the original variable.","faq.newScratcherCloudTitle":"I am logged in, but I cannot use projects with cloud variables What is going on?","faq.newScratcherCloudBody":"If you are still a \"New Scratcher\" on the website, you will not be able to use projects with cloud variables. You need to become a \"Scratcher\" to have access to cloud variables. See the Accounts section (above) for more information about the transition from “New Scratcher” to \"Scratcher\".","faq.multiplayerTitle":"Is it possible to make multiplayer games with cloud variables?","faq.multiplayerBody":"Multiplayer games may be difficult to create, due to network speed and synchronization issues. However, some Scratchers are coming up with creative ways to use the cloud variables for turn-by-turn and other types of games.","faq.schoolsTitle":"سكراتش في المدرسة","faq.howTitle":"How is Scratch used in schools?","faq.howBody":"Scratch is used in hundreds of thousands of schools around the world, in many different subject areas (including language arts, science, history, math, and computer science).

However, we understand that some educators prefer that their students not participate in an online community. These educators may wish to install Scratch Desktop, which runs offline and locally on a desktop or laptop computer.","faq.teacherAccountTitle":"What is a Scratch Teacher Account?","faq.teacherAccountBody":"A Scratch Teacher Account provides teachers and other educators with additional features to manage student participation on Scratch, including the ability to create student accounts, organize student projects into studios, and monitor student comments.

In addition, blocks are slightly bigger in Scratch 3.0 to help address issues we observed with new users having trouble clicking and dragging small interface elements.","faq.extensionsScratch3Title":"Where did the Pen blocks go? Where did the Music blocks go? Where did the Video Sensing blocks go?","faq.extensionsScratch3Body":"The Pen, Music, and Video Sensing blocks have been moved into extensions.

We consider even a minor change to be a valid remix, as long as credit is given to the original project creator and others who made significant contributions to the remix.","faq.remixableTitle":"Kenapa Scratch Team mengharuskan agar semua karya boleh diremix atau \"remixable\"?","faq.remixableBody":"We believe that remixing other people’s projects is a great way to learn to program and to create interesting projects. Through remixing, creative ideas spread through the Scratch community, and everyone benefits. All projects shared on the Scratch website are covered by the “Creative Commons Share Alike” license, which means that you can remix any project you see on the Scratch website -- and everyone else can remix any of the projects that you share on the website.","faq.creativeCommonsTitle":"Bagaimana jika saya tidak ingin orang lain untuk meremix karya-karya saya?","faq.creativeCommonsBody":"Remixing is an important part of the Scratch community. If you don’t want others to view or remix your creations, you can still create projects on the Scratch website, but don’t share them on the website.","faq.fairUseTitle":"Bolehkan saya menggunakan gambar / suara / media dari internet dalam karya-karya saya?","faq.fairUseBody":"If you choose to integrate someone else’s work into your own, be sure to give them credit on the project “credits” section, and include a link back to the original.

But you need an account to save and share projects, write comments and forum posts, and participate in other \"social\" activities in the community (like \"loving\" other people’s projects).","faq.createAccountTitle":"How can I create an account?","faq.createAccountBody":"Just click \"Join\" on the Scratch home page. You’ll need to respond to a few questions, and provide an email address. It takes just a couple minutes, and it’s totally free!","faq.checkConfirmedTitle":"Bagaimana cara saya mengecek apakah akun saya terkonfirmasi?","faq.howToConfirmTitle":"Bagaimana cara saya mengonfirmasi akun saya?","faq.howToConfirmBody":"After you create a new account on Scratch, you’ll receive an email message with a link. Just click the link to confirm your account. Once you confirm your account, you’ll be able to share projects, write comments, and create studios. Confirming your account also lets you receive email updates from the Scratch Team. If you cannot find the email with the confirmation link, check your Spam folder. If you still can’t find it, and want to receive another copy, go to your Account Settings, click the Email tab, and follow the instructions there. Please note that it may take up to an hour for the email to arrive. If you still don't see the email after an hour, {contactLink}.","faq.contactLinkText":"let us know","faq.checkConfirmedBody":"To check whether your account is confirmed, login to your Scratch account and go to your {settingsLink} page.

(Note that we don't promote New Scratchers to Scratcher on request )","faq.multipleAccountTitle":"Bolehkan saya punya lebih dari satu akun?","faq.multipleAccountBody":"It's fine to have a few accounts on the Scratch website, as long as none of them are used to break the {cgLink}. In that case, all related accounts may be blocked or deleted.","faq.multipleLoginTitle":"Bolehkah lebih dari satu orang menggunakan satu akun?","faq.multipleLoginBody":"This is not allowed because the website and project editor can easily get confused when more than one person is logged in to the same account. When an account does something that violates the {cgLink}, all related accounts may be blocked or deleted. If you share an account with someone who does something bad with it, this means your accounts can be blocked for what the other person did.","faq.changeUsernameTitle":"Bisakan saya mengubah username saya?","faq.changeUsernameBody":"The structure of the Scratch website depends on having a consistent account name, so it’s not possible to change your username. If you really need to switch to a new username, you can make a new account, but you'll have to copy your projects over to the new account on your own.","faq.shareInfoTitle":"Informasi apa yang boleh saya bagikan menggunakan akun saya?","faq.shareInfoBody":"Please don’t share personal contact information, such as your physical address, email, phone number, or anything else that can be used to make contact outside of the Scratch website. Please report projects, comments, or forum posts that contain this kind of information, so the Scratch Team can remove the information, and remind the author of our policy against sharing personal contact information.","faq.deleteAccountTitle":"Bagaimana cara saya menghapus akun saya?","faq.deleteAccountBody":"Login to Scratch, and then click your username in the top right-hand corner. Select \"Account Settings\", then click the \"I want to delete my account\" link at the bottom of the page.

Kami mengecek laporan-laporan setiap hari, berkali-kali sehari - jadi jangan khawatir, kami akan membereskan semuanya.","faq.reviewContentTitle":"Apa yang dilakukan Scratch Team saat sesuatu dilaporkan?","faq.reviewContentBody":"The Scratch Team reviews reported comments and projects every day. If something breaks the Scratch {cgLink}, we will remove it and send a warning to the account. We may also block the accounts or networks that were used to share it, depending on what was shared and if the person has been sent warnings before","faq.blockedAccountTitle":"Apa yang terjadi saat suatu akun diblokir?","faq.blockedAccountBody":"When an account is blocked, the owner can no longer access their account, use it to create projects, or post new comments. When they login, they see a page that explains why the account was blocked, along with a web form they can use to request to be unblocked. If the owner can show that they understand why their account was blocked, and promises to follow the Scratch {cgLink} in the future, they will be unblocked.","faq.stolenAccountTitle":"Someone got access to my account and got my account blocked. What do I do?","faq.stolenAccountBody":"You are responsible for keeping your password secure. If someone you know took control of your account and did bad things, tell the adults in charge of the computer they used. If you think someone you don’t know has access to your account, change the password and / or use the {contactLink} link to explain the situation. If your account was blocked for doing something that you did which broke the Scratch {cgLink}, please don’t tell us that someone else did it. When people tell us someone else used their account to do something bad, we then need to try and talk to that person before we can restore the account. This means your account will just stay blocked for a lot longer than if you are honest with us about what happened.","faq.aboutExtensionsTitle":"What are extensions?","faq.aboutExtensionsBody":"In the Scratch editor, you can add collections of extra blocks called \"extensions.\" For example, there are extensions that enable you to program physical devices (such as micro:bit and LEGO robotics kits) and to translate text within your Scratch projects. We will continue to add new extensions over time, so what you can do with Scratch will continue to grow over time. ","faq.howToAddExtensionsTitle":"How do I add an extension to a project?","faq.howToAddExtensionsBody":"If you click on the \"Extensions\" button in the bottom left corner of the Scratch programming editor, you will see a listing of all Scratch Extensions.

You can add multiple extensions to the same project.","faq.createExtensionsTitle":"How do I create my own extension for Scratch","faq.createExtensionsBody":"The Scratch Team will be publishing specifications and guidelines for extensions in the future. Once available, you will be able to submit extensions to the Scratch Team for consideration in the official Scratch 3.0 extensions library. We’ll also provide guidelines for developing and distributing \"experimental\" extensions, which can be used to create projects on individual computers, but not shared in the Scratch online community.","faq.scratchXTitle":"What will happen to the ScratchX website?","faq.scratchXBody":"The ScratchX website (scratchx.org) was an experimental testbed for extensions.

You’ll find tutorials for entire projects (like \"Make a Chase Game\") or specific blocks and features (such as \"Record a Sound\" or \"Make it Spin\"). More tutorials will be added soon (such as \"Pong Game\" and \"Make It Fly\").","faq.remixDefinitionTitle":"Was ist ein Remix?","faq.remixDefinitionBody":"Wenn ein Scratcher ein Projekt eines anderen kopiert und es modifiziert, indem er oder sie eigene Ideen einbringt (z.B. Skripte oder Kostüme verändert), wird das Ergebnis \"Remix\" genannt. Jedes Projekt, das auf der Scratch-Website veröffentlicht wird, kann so bearbeitet werden. Wir betrachten auch eine kleinere Veränderung als einen gültigen Remix, solange dem ursprünglichen Projekt-Ersteller und anderen, die einen signifikanten Beitrag zu dem Remix geleistet haben, Anerkennung gezollt wird.","faq.remixableTitle":"Warum verlangt das Scratch-Team, dass alle Projekte \"remixbar\" sind?","faq.remixableBody":"We believe that remixing other people’s projects is a great way to learn to program and to create interesting projects. Through remixing, creative ideas spread through the Scratch community, and everyone benefits. All projects shared on the Scratch website are covered by the “Creative Commons Share Alike” license, which means that you can remix any project you see on the Scratch website -- and everyone else can remix any of the projects that you share on the website.","faq.creativeCommonsTitle":"Was ist, wenn ich nicht will, dass andere meine Projekte remixen?","faq.creativeCommonsBody":"Remixing is an important part of the Scratch community. If you don’t want others to view or remix your creations, you can still create projects on the Scratch website, but don’t share them on the website.","faq.fairUseTitle":"Kann ich Bilder / Klänge / Medien aus dem Internet in meinen Projekten benutzen?","faq.fairUseBody":"If you choose to integrate someone else’s work into your own, be sure to give them credit on the project “credits” section, and include a link back to the original. To find art / sounds that are already licensed for remixing, check out the {ccLink}.","faq.ccLinkText":"Creative Commons search page","faq.whyAccountTitle":"Why is it useful to have a Scratch account?","faq.whyAccountBody":"Even without an account, you can play other people’s projects, read comments and forums, and even create your own projects. But you need an account to save and share projects, write comments and forum posts, and participate in other \"social\" activities in the community (like \"loving\" other people’s projects).","faq.createAccountTitle":"How can I create an account?","faq.createAccountBody":"Just click \"Join\" on the Scratch home page. You’ll need to respond to a few questions, and provide an email address. It takes just a couple minutes, and it’s totally free!","faq.checkConfirmedTitle":"Wie kann ich überprüfen ob mein Konto bestätigt wurde?","faq.howToConfirmTitle":"Wie bestätige ich mein Benutzerkonto?","faq.howToConfirmBody":"After you create a new account on Scratch, you’ll receive an email message with a link. Just click the link to confirm your account. Once you confirm your account, you’ll be able to share projects, write comments, and create studios. Confirming your account also lets you receive email updates from the Scratch Team. If you cannot find the email with the confirmation link, check your Spam folder. If you still can’t find it, and want to receive another copy, go to your Account Settings, click the Email tab, and follow the instructions there. Please note that it may take up to an hour for the email to arrive. If you still don't see the email after an hour, {contactLink}.","faq.contactLinkText":"let us know","faq.checkConfirmedBody":"To check whether your account is confirmed, login to your Scratch account and go to your {settingsLink} page. Confirmed email addresses will show a small green checkmark. Otherwise, you will see the text \"Your email address is unconfirmed\" in orange.","faq.settingsLinkText":"Email Settings","faq.requireConfirmTitle":"Muss ich mein Benutzerkonto bestätigen?","faq.requireConfirmBody":"You can still use many aspects of Scratch without confirming your account, including creating and saving projects (without sharing them).","faq.forgotPasswordTitle":"I forgot my username or password. How can I reset it?","faq.forgotPasswordBody":"Enter your username or email address on the {resetLink} page. The website will send an email to the address associated with your username and a link you can use to reset your password.","faq.resetLinkText":"Password Reset","faq.changePasswordTitle":"Wie kann ich mein Kennwort ändern?","faq.changePasswordBody":"Login to your Scratch account, then visit our {changeLink} page where you can change your password.","faq.changeLinkText":"Password Settings","faq.changeEmailTitle":"Wie kann ich meine E-Mail-Adresse ändern?","faq.changeEmailBody":"Login to your Scratch account, then visit our {changeEmailLink} page where you can change your email address.","faq.newScratcherTitle":"Wie werde ich als 'Neuer Scratcher' zum 'Scratcher'?","faq.newScratcherBody":"When you create an account, you’ll be labelled as a “New Scratcher.” To make the transition to \"Scratcher\", you should make and share projects, comment helpfully on other Scratchers’ projects, and be patient! After you’ve met the requirements, a link will appear on your profile page inviting you to become a Scratcher, and you’ll have some additional capabilities on the Scratch website. (Note that we don't promote New Scratchers to Scratcher on request )","faq.multipleAccountTitle":"Kann ich mehr als einen Account besitzen?","faq.multipleAccountBody":"It's fine to have a few accounts on the Scratch website, as long as none of them are used to break the {cgLink}. In that case, all related accounts may be blocked or deleted.","faq.multipleLoginTitle":"Ist es in Ordnung, wenn sich mehr als eine Person an einem einzigen Benutzerkonto anmeldet?","faq.multipleLoginBody":"This is not allowed because the website and project editor can easily get confused when more than one person is logged in to the same account. When an account does something that violates the {cgLink}, all related accounts may be blocked or deleted. If you share an account with someone who does something bad with it, this means your accounts can be blocked for what the other person did.","faq.changeUsernameTitle":"Kann ich meinen Benutzernamen ändern?","faq.changeUsernameBody":"The structure of the Scratch website depends on having a consistent account name, so it’s not possible to change your username. If you really need to switch to a new username, you can make a new account, but you'll have to copy your projects over to the new account on your own.","faq.shareInfoTitle":"Welche Informationen kann ich auf / mit meinem Account veröffentlichen?","faq.shareInfoBody":"Please don’t share personal contact information, such as your physical address, email, phone number, or anything else that can be used to make contact outside of the Scratch website. Please report projects, comments, or forum posts that contain this kind of information, so the Scratch Team can remove the information, and remind the author of our policy against sharing personal contact information.","faq.deleteAccountTitle":"Wie lösche ich meinen Account?","faq.deleteAccountBody":"Login to Scratch, and then click your username in the top right-hand corner. Select \"Account Settings\", then click the \"I want to delete my account\" link at the bottom of the page. But you should only do this if you are absolutely sure that you want to delete your account.","faq.scratchFreeTitle":"Is Scratch free? Can I use it wherever I want?","faq.scratchFreeBody":"Yes! Scratch is available free of charge. You can use it in your school, and you can teach a course about it (even a course that costs money). You don't need to buy a license: it's free!","faq.scratchScreenshotTitle":"Kann ich Screenshots von Scratch in einem Buch oder einer Präsentation verwenden?","faq.scratchScreenshotBody":"Yes, you can use screenshots / images of the Scratch application and website in a book or presentation, and consider them to be licensed under the {licenseLink} license. We ask that you include a note somewhere in your materials  saying: \"Scratch is a project of the Scratch Foundation, in collaboration with the Lifelong Kindergarten Group at the MIT Media Lab. It is available for free at https://scratch.mit.edu\".","faq.licenseLinkText":"Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike","faq.scratchDescriptionTitle":"Darf ich eine Beschreibung von Scratch in Broschüren oder anderen Materialien verwenden?","faq.scratchDescriptionBody":"Sure! We recommend the following description: \"Scratch is a coding  language and online community where you can create your own interactive stories, games, and animations -- and share your creations with others around the world. As young people create and share Scratch projects, they learn to think creatively, reason systematically, and work collaboratively. Scratch is a project of the {sfLink} in collaboration with the Lifelong Kindergarten group at the MIT Media Lab. It is available for free at https://scratch.mit.edu\"","faq.presentScratchTitle":"Kann ich Scratch bei einer Konferenz präsentieren?","faq.presentScratchBody":"Please feel free to make presentations about Scratch to educators or other groups.","faq.supportMaterialTitle":"Darf ich Materialien, Figuren, Grafiken, Klänge oder Beispielprojekte von Scratch benutzen oder remixen, die ich auf der Webseite gefunden habe?","faq.supportMaterialBody":"Yes: Most Scratch support materials on the Scratch website are available under the {licenseLink} license. There are a few exceptions: the Scratch Logo, Scratch Cat, Gobo, Pico, Nano, Giga, and Tera are Scratch trademarks, and can not be used without explicit permission from the Scratch Team.","faq.sellProjectsTitle":"Darf ich meine Scratch-Projekte verkaufen?","faq.sellProjectsBody":"Yes: Your Scratch project is your creation. But keep in mind that once you share your project on the Scratch website, everyone is free to download, remix, and reuse the project based on the terms of the {licenseLink} license. So if you intend to sell your project, you may want to un-share it from the Scratch website.","faq.sourceCodeTitle":"Wo finde ich den Quelltext von Scratch?","faq.sourceCodeBody":"The source code for the Scratch programming editor can be found on {guiLink}.

There’s a link at the bottom of every page on Scratch.","faq.reportContentTitle":"Was soll ich tun, wenn ich etwas Unangebrachtes sehe?","faq.reportContentBody":"You can click the link that says \"report\" on any project, comment, discussion post, studio, or profile page where you see something that isn't ok for Scratch. If the situation is complicated, you can use the {contactLink} link (available at the bottom of every page) to explain. Be sure to include as much detail as you can, with links to relevant pages.","faq.noFlameTitle":"Was soll ich machen, wenn ich sehe, dass jemand gemein oder respektlos ist?","faq.noFlameBody":"Schüre das Feuer nicht! Auf gemeine Kommentare mit weiteren gemeinen Kommentaren zu antworten macht die Dinge nur schlechter und kann dazu führen, dass dein Benutzerkonto gesperrt wird. Melde stattdessen einfach alles, was respektlos und nicht konstruktiv erscheint, und wir klären das mit dem Autor. Wir prüfen die Meldungen täglich - sei also versichert, wir kümmern uns darum.","faq.reviewContentTitle":"Was unternimmt das Scratch-Team, wenn etwas gemeldet oder gekennzeichnet wird?","faq.reviewContentBody":"The Scratch Team reviews reported comments and projects every day. If something breaks the Scratch {cgLink}, we will remove it and send a warning to the account. We may also block the accounts or networks that were used to share it, depending on what was shared and if the person has been sent warnings before","faq.blockedAccountTitle":"Was passiert, wenn ein Benutzerkonto gesperrt wurde?","faq.blockedAccountBody":"When an account is blocked, the owner can no longer access their account, use it to create projects, or post new comments. When they login, they see a page that explains why the account was blocked, along with a web form they can use to request to be unblocked. If the owner can show that they understand why their account was blocked, and promises to follow the Scratch {cgLink} in the future, they will be unblocked.","faq.stolenAccountTitle":"Someone got access to my account and got my account blocked. What do I do?","faq.stolenAccountBody":"You are responsible for keeping your password secure. If someone you know took control of your account and did bad things, tell the adults in charge of the computer they used. If you think someone you don’t know has access to your account, change the password and / or use the {contactLink} link to explain the situation. If your account was blocked for doing something that you did which broke the Scratch {cgLink}, please don’t tell us that someone else did it. When people tell us someone else used their account to do something bad, we then need to try and talk to that person before we can restore the account. This means your account will just stay blocked for a lot longer than if you are honest with us about what happened.","faq.aboutExtensionsTitle":"What are extensions?","faq.aboutExtensionsBody":"In the Scratch editor, you can add collections of extra blocks called \"extensions.\" For example, there are extensions that enable you to program physical devices (such as micro:bit and LEGO robotics kits) and to translate text within your Scratch projects. We will continue to add new extensions over time, so what you can do with Scratch will continue to grow over time. ","faq.howToAddExtensionsTitle":"How do I add an extension to a project?","faq.howToAddExtensionsBody":"If you click on the \"Extensions\" button in the bottom left corner of the Scratch programming editor, you will see a listing of all Scratch Extensions. When you select one of the extensions, a new category of blocks will be added to your project. The extension will be automatically loaded each time your project is opened. You can add multiple extensions to the same project.","faq.createExtensionsTitle":"How do I create my own extension for Scratch","faq.createExtensionsBody":"The Scratch Team will be publishing specifications and guidelines for extensions in the future. Once available, you will be able to submit extensions to the Scratch Team for consideration in the official Scratch 3.0 extensions library. We’ll also provide guidelines for developing and distributing \"experimental\" extensions, which can be used to create projects on individual computers, but not shared in the Scratch online community.","faq.scratchXTitle":"What will happen to the ScratchX website?","faq.scratchXBody":"The ScratchX website (scratchx.org) was an experimental testbed for extensions. Extensions created for ScratchX are not compatible with Scratch 3.0. Once experimental extensions are fully supported in Scratch we will discontinue support for ScratchX and provide developers and users time to transition off of ScratchX to the new extensions platform.","faq.cloudDataInfoTitle":"What are cloud variables?","faq.cloudDataInfoBody":"Cloud variables allow for data from a project to be saved and shared with other people in the Scratch community.

If people \"see inside\" or remix your code, it creates a copy of the variable and does not affect or change the original variable.","faq.newScratcherCloudTitle":"I am logged in, but I cannot use projects with cloud variables What is going on?","faq.newScratcherCloudBody":"If you are still a \"New Scratcher\" on the website, you will not be able to use projects with cloud variables. You need to become a \"Scratcher\" to have access to cloud variables. See the Accounts section (above) for more information about the transition from “New Scratcher” to \"Scratcher\".","faq.multiplayerTitle":"Is it possible to make multiplayer games with cloud variables?","faq.multiplayerBody":"Multiplayer games may be difficult to create, due to network speed and synchronization issues. However, some Scratchers are coming up with creative ways to use the cloud variables for turn-by-turn and other types of games.","faq.schoolsTitle":"Scratch in der Schule","faq.howTitle":"Wie wird Scratch in Schulen genutzt?","faq.howBody":"Scratch is used in hundreds of thousands of schools around the world, in many different subject areas (including language arts, science, history, math, and computer science).

If your account was blocked for doing something that you did which broke the Scratch {cgLink}, please don’t tell us that someone else did it.

In addition, blocks are slightly bigger in Scratch 3.0 to help address issues we observed with new users having trouble clicking and dragging small interface elements.","faq.extensionsScratch3Title":"Where did the Pen blocks go? Where did the Music blocks go? Where did the Video Sensing blocks go?","faq.extensionsScratch3Body":"The Pen, Music, and Video Sensing blocks have been moved into extensions.

More tutorials will be added soon (such as \"Pong Game\" and \"Make It Fly\").","faq.remixDefinitionTitle":"What is a remix?","faq.remixDefinitionBody":"When a Scratcher makes a copy of someone else’s project and modifies it to add their own ideas (for example, by changing scripts or costumes), the resulting project is called a \"remix\". Every project shared to the Scratch website can be remixed. We consider even a minor change to be a valid remix, as long as credit is given to the original project creator and others who made significant contributions to the remix.","faq.remixableTitle":"Why does the Scratch Team require that all projects be “remixable”?","faq.remixableBody":"We believe that remixing other people’s projects is a great way to learn to program and to create interesting projects. Through remixing, creative ideas spread through the Scratch community, and everyone benefits. All projects shared on the Scratch website are covered by the “Creative Commons Share Alike” license, which means that you can remix any project you see on the Scratch website -- and everyone else can remix any of the projects that you share on the website.","faq.creativeCommonsTitle":"What if I don’t want others to remix my projects?","faq.creativeCommonsBody":"Remixing is an important part of the Scratch community. If you don’t want others to view or remix your creations, you can still create projects on the Scratch website, but don’t share them on the website.","faq.fairUseTitle":"Can I use images / sounds / media from the internet in my projects?","faq.fairUseBody":"If you choose to integrate someone else’s work into your own, be sure to give them credit on the project “credits” section, and include a link back to the original. To find art / sounds that are already licensed for remixing, check out the {ccLink}.","faq.ccLinkText":"Creative Commons search page","faq.whyAccountTitle":"Why is it useful to have a Scratch account?","faq.whyAccountBody":"Even without an account, you can play other people’s projects, read comments and forums, and even create your own projects. But you need an account to save and share projects, write comments and forum posts, and participate in other \"social\" activities in the community (like \"loving\" other people’s projects).","faq.createAccountTitle":"How can I create an account?","faq.createAccountBody":"Just click \"Join\" on the Scratch home page. You’ll need to respond to a few questions, and provide an email address. It takes just a couple minutes, and it’s totally free!","faq.checkConfirmedTitle":"How can I check whether my account has been confirmed?","faq.howToConfirmTitle":"How do I confirm my account?","faq.howToConfirmBody":"After you create a new account on Scratch, you’ll receive an email message with a link. Just click the link to confirm your account. Once you confirm your account, you’ll be able to share projects, write comments, and create studios. Confirming your account also lets you receive email updates from the Scratch Team. If you cannot find the email with the confirmation link, check your Spam folder. If you still can’t find it, and want to receive another copy, go to your Account Settings, click the Email tab, and follow the instructions there. Please note that it may take up to an hour for the email to arrive. If you still don't see the email after an hour, {contactLink}.","faq.contactLinkText":"let us know","faq.checkConfirmedBody":"To check whether your account is confirmed, login to your Scratch account and go to your {settingsLink} page. Confirmed email addresses will show a small green checkmark. Otherwise, you will see the text \"Your email address is unconfirmed\" in orange.","faq.settingsLinkText":"Email Settings","faq.requireConfirmTitle":"Do I have to confirm my account?","faq.requireConfirmBody":"You can still use many aspects of Scratch without confirming your account, including creating and saving projects (without sharing them).","faq.forgotPasswordTitle":"I forgot my username or password.

After you’ve met the requirements, a link will appear on your profile page inviting you to become a Scratcher, and you’ll have some additional capabilities on the Scratch website. (Note that we don't promote New Scratchers to Scratcher on request )","faq.multipleAccountTitle":"Can I have more than one account?","faq.multipleAccountBody":"It's fine to have a few accounts on the Scratch website, as long as none of them are used to break the {cgLink}. In that case, all related accounts may be blocked or deleted.","faq.multipleLoginTitle":"Is it OK to have more than one person logged into an account?","faq.multipleLoginBody":"This is not allowed because the website and project editor can easily get confused when more than one person is logged in to the same account. When an account does something that violates the {cgLink}, all related accounts may be blocked or deleted. If you share an account with someone who does something bad with it, this means your accounts can be blocked for what the other person did.","faq.changeUsernameTitle":"Can I change my username?","faq.changeUsernameBody":"The structure of the Scratch website depends on having a consistent account name, so it’s not possible to change your username. If you really need to switch to a new username, you can make a new account, but you'll have to copy your projects over to the new account on your own.","faq.shareInfoTitle":"What information can I share on / with my account?","faq.shareInfoBody":"Please don’t share personal contact information, such as your physical address, email, phone number, or anything else that can be used to make contact outside of the Scratch website. Please report projects, comments, or forum posts that contain this kind of information, so the Scratch Team can remove the information, and remind the author of our policy against sharing personal contact information.","faq.deleteAccountTitle":"How do I delete my account?","faq.deleteAccountBody":"Login to Scratch, and then click your username in the top right-hand corner. Select \"Account Settings\", then click the \"I want to delete my account\" link at the bottom of the page. But you should only do this if you are absolutely sure that you want to delete your account.","faq.scratchFreeTitle":"Is Scratch free? Can I use it wherever I want?","faq.scratchFreeBody":"Yes! Scratch is available free of charge. You can use it in your school, and you can teach a course about it (even a course that costs money). You don't need to buy a license: it's free!","faq.scratchScreenshotTitle":"Can I use screenshots of Scratch in a book or presentation?","faq.scratchScreenshotBody":"Yes, you can use screenshots / images of the Scratch application and website in a book or presentation, and consider them to be licensed under the {licenseLink} license. We ask that you include a note somewhere in your materials  saying: \"Scratch is a project of the Scratch Foundation, in collaboration with the Lifelong Kindergarten Group at the MIT Media Lab. It is available for free at https://scratch.mit.edu\".","faq.licenseLinkText":"Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike","faq.scratchDescriptionTitle":"Can I include a description of Scratch in brochures or other materials?","faq.scratchDescriptionBody":"Sure! We recommend the following description: \"Scratch is a coding  language and online community where you can create your own interactive stories, games, and animations -- and share your creations with others around the world.

There are a few exceptions: the Scratch Logo, Scratch Cat, Gobo, Pico, Nano, Giga, and Tera are Scratch trademarks, and can not be used without explicit permission from the Scratch Team.","faq.sellProjectsTitle":"Can I sell my Scratch projects?","faq.sellProjectsBody":"Yes: Your Scratch project is your creation. But keep in mind that once you share your project on the Scratch website, everyone is free to download, remix, and reuse the project based on the terms of the {licenseLink} license. So if you intend to sell your project, you may want to un-share it from the Scratch website.","faq.sourceCodeTitle":"Where can I find the source code for Scratch?","faq.sourceCodeBody":"The source code for the Scratch programming editor can be found on {guiLink}.

Be sure to include as much detail as you can, with links to relevant pages.","faq.noFlameTitle":"What do I do if I see someone being mean or disrespectful?","faq.noFlameBody":"Don’t add to the flames! Responding to mean comments with more mean comments just makes things worse, and could result in your account being blocked. Instead, simply report anything that is disrespectful or unconstructive, and we’ll follow up with the author. We check reports every day, multiple times per day - so rest assured, we'll sort things out.","faq.reviewContentTitle":"What does the Scratch team do when something is reported or flagged?","faq.reviewContentBody":"The Scratch Team reviews reported comments and projects every day.

When they login, they see a page that explains why the account was blocked, along with a web form they can use to request to be unblocked. If the owner can show that they understand why their account was blocked, and promises to follow the Scratch {cgLink} in the future, they will be unblocked.","faq.stolenAccountTitle":"Someone got access to my account and got my account blocked. What do I do?","faq.stolenAccountBody":"You are responsible for keeping your password secure. If someone you know took control of your account and did bad things, tell the adults in charge of the computer they used. If you think someone you don’t know has access to your account, change the password and / or use the {contactLink} link to explain the situation. If your account was blocked for doing something that you did which broke the Scratch {cgLink}, please don’t tell us that someone else did it. When people tell us someone else used their account to do something bad, we then need to try and talk to that person before we can restore the account. This means your account will just stay blocked for a lot longer than if you are honest with us about what happened.","faq.aboutExtensionsTitle":"What are extensions?","faq.aboutExtensionsBody":"In the Scratch editor, you can add collections of extra blocks called \"extensions.\" For example, there are extensions that enable you to program physical devices (such as micro:bit and LEGO robotics kits) and to translate text within your Scratch projects. We will continue to add new extensions over time, so what you can do with Scratch will continue to grow over time. ","faq.howToAddExtensionsTitle":"How do I add an extension to a project?","faq.howToAddExtensionsBody":"If you click on the \"Extensions\" button in the bottom left corner of the Scratch programming editor, you will see a listing of all Scratch Extensions.

Once available, you will be able to submit extensions to the Scratch Team for consideration in the official Scratch 3.0 extensions library. We’ll also provide guidelines for developing and distributing \"experimental\" extensions, which can be used to create projects on individual computers, but not shared in the Scratch online community.","faq.scratchXTitle":"What will happen to the ScratchX website?","faq.scratchXBody":"The ScratchX website (scratchx.org) was an experimental testbed for extensions. Extensions created for ScratchX are not compatible with Scratch 3.0. Once experimental extensions are fully supported in Scratch we will discontinue support for ScratchX and provide developers and users time to transition off of ScratchX to the new extensions platform.","faq.cloudDataInfoTitle":"What are cloud variables?","faq.cloudDataInfoBody":"Cloud variables allow for data from a project to be saved and shared with other people in the Scratch community.

If people \"see inside\" or remix your code, it creates a copy of the variable and does not affect or change the original variable.","faq.newScratcherCloudTitle":"I am logged in, but I cannot use projects with cloud variables What is going on?","faq.newScratcherCloudBody":"If you are still a \"New Scratcher\" on the website, you will not be able to use projects with cloud variables. You need to become a \"Scratcher\" to have access to cloud variables. See the Accounts section (above) for more information about the transition from “New Scratcher” to \"Scratcher\".","faq.multiplayerTitle":"Is it possible to make multiplayer games with cloud variables?","faq.multiplayerBody":"Multiplayer games may be difficult to create, due to network speed and synchronization issues. However, some Scratchers are coming up with creative ways to use the cloud variables for turn-by-turn and other types of games.","faq.schoolsTitle":"Scratch en las Escuelas","faq.howTitle":"How is Scratch used in schools?","faq.howBody":"Scratch is used in hundreds of thousands of schools around the world, in many different subject areas (including language arts, science, history, math, and computer science).

You’ll find tutorials for entire projects (like \"Make a Chase Game\") or specific blocks and features (such as \"Record a Sound\" or \"Make it Spin\"). More tutorials will be added soon (such as \"Pong Game\" and \"Make It Fly\").","faq.remixDefinitionTitle":"Hvad er et remix?","faq.remixDefinitionBody":"When a Scratcher makes a copy of someone else’s project and modifies it to add their own ideas (for example, by changing scripts or costumes), the resulting project is called a \"remix\". Every project shared to the Scratch website can be remixed. We consider even a minor change to be a valid remix, as long as credit is given to the original project creator and others who made significant contributions to the remix.","faq.remixableTitle":"Hvorfor kræver Scratch Teamet at alle projekter kan \"remixes\"?","faq.remixableBody":"We believe that remixing other people’s projects is a great way to learn to program and to create interesting projects. Through remixing, creative ideas spread through the Scratch community, and everyone benefits. All projects shared on the Scratch website are covered by the “Creative Commons Share Alike” license, which means that you can remix any project you see on the Scratch website -- and everyone else can remix any of the projects that you share on the website.","faq.creativeCommonsTitle":"Hvad hvis jeg ikke vil have at andre bygger videre på mine projekter?","faq.creativeCommonsBody":"Remixing is an important part of the Scratch community. If you don’t want others to view or remix your creations, you can still create projects on the Scratch website, but don’t share them on the website.","faq.fairUseTitle":"Kan jeg bruge billeder / lyde / andre medier fra internettet i mine projekter?","faq.fairUseBody":"If you choose to integrate someone else’s work into your own, be sure to give them credit on the project “credits” section, and include a link back to the original. To find art / sounds that are already licensed for remixing, check out the {ccLink}.","faq.ccLinkText":"Creative Commons search page","faq.whyAccountTitle":"Why is it useful to have a Scratch account?","faq.whyAccountBody":"Even without an account, you can play other people’s projects, read comments and forums, and even create your own projects. But you need an account to save and share projects, write comments and forum posts, and participate in other \"social\" activities in the community (like \"loving\" other people’s projects).","faq.createAccountTitle":"How can I create an account?","faq.createAccountBody":"Just click \"Join\" on the Scratch home page. You’ll need to respond to a few questions, and provide an email address. It takes just a couple minutes, and it’s totally free!","faq.checkConfirmedTitle":"How can I check whether my account has been confirmed?","faq.howToConfirmTitle":"Hvordan sletter jeg min konto?","faq.howToConfirmBody":"After you create a new account on Scratch, you’ll receive an email message with a link. Just click the link to confirm your account. Once you confirm your account, you’ll be able to share projects, write comments, and create studios. Confirming your account also lets you receive email updates from the Scratch Team. If you cannot find the email with the confirmation link, check your Spam folder. If you still can’t find it, and want to receive another copy, go to your Account Settings, click the Email tab, and follow the instructions there. Please note that it may take up to an hour for the email to arrive. If you still don't see the email after an hour, {contactLink}.","faq.contactLinkText":"let us know","faq.checkConfirmedBody":"To check whether your account is confirmed, login to your Scratch account and go to your {settingsLink} page. Confirmed email addresses will show a small green checkmark. Otherwise, you will see the text \"Your email address is unconfirmed\" in orange.","faq.settingsLinkText":"Email Settings","faq.requireConfirmTitle":"Do I have to confirm my account?","faq.requireConfirmBody":"You can still use many aspects of Scratch without confirming your account, including creating and saving projects (without sharing them).","faq.forgotPasswordTitle":"I forgot my username or password. How can I reset it?","faq.forgotPasswordBody":"Enter your username or email address on the {resetLink} page. The website will send an email to the address associated with your username and a link you can use to reset your password.","faq.resetLinkText":"Password Reset","faq.changePasswordTitle":"Hvordan ændrer jeg mit kodeord?","faq.changePasswordBody":"Login to your Scratch account, then visit our {changeLink} page where you can change your password.","faq.changeLinkText":"Password Settings","faq.changeEmailTitle":"How do I change my email address?","faq.changeEmailBody":"Login to your Scratch account, then visit our {changeEmailLink} page where you can change your email address.","faq.newScratcherTitle":"Hvordan overgår jeg fra 'Ny Scratcher' til 'Scratcher'?","faq.newScratcherBody":"When you create an account, you’ll be labelled as a “New Scratcher.” To make the transition to \"Scratcher\", you should make and share projects, comment helpfully on other Scratchers’ projects, and be patient! After you’ve met the requirements, a link will appear on your profile page inviting you to become a Scratcher, and you’ll have some additional capabilities on the Scratch website. (Note that we don't promote New Scratchers to Scratcher on request )","faq.multipleAccountTitle":"Kan jeg have mere end en konto?","faq.multipleAccountBody":"It's fine to have a few accounts on the Scratch website, as long as none of them are used to break the {cgLink}. In that case, all related accounts may be blocked or deleted.","faq.multipleLoginTitle":"Er det OK at mere end en person er logget ind på en konto?","faq.multipleLoginBody":"This is not allowed because the website and project editor can easily get confused when more than one person is logged in to the same account. When an account does something that violates the {cgLink}, all related accounts may be blocked or deleted. If you share an account with someone who does something bad with it, this means your accounts can be blocked for what the other person did.","faq.changeUsernameTitle":"Kan jeg ændre mit brugernavn?","faq.changeUsernameBody":"The structure of the Scratch website depends on having a consistent account name, so it’s not possible to change your username. If you really need to switch to a new username, you can make a new account, but you'll have to copy your projects over to the new account on your own.","faq.shareInfoTitle":"Hvilke informationer kan jeg dele på / og med min konto?","faq.shareInfoBody":"Please don’t share personal contact information, such as your physical address, email, phone number, or anything else that can be used to make contact outside of the Scratch website. Please report projects, comments, or forum posts that contain this kind of information, so the Scratch Team can remove the information, and remind the author of our policy against sharing personal contact information.","faq.deleteAccountTitle":"Hvordan sletter jeg min konto?","faq.deleteAccountBody":"Login to Scratch, and then click your username in the top right-hand corner. Select \"Account Settings\", then click the \"I want to delete my account\" link at the bottom of the page. But you should only do this if you are absolutely sure that you want to delete your account.","faq.scratchFreeTitle":"Is Scratch free? Can I use it wherever I want?","faq.scratchFreeBody":"Yes! Scratch is available free of charge. You can use it in your school, and you can teach a course about it (even a course that costs money). You don't need to buy a license: it's free!","faq.scratchScreenshotTitle":"Can I use screenshots of Scratch in a book or presentation?","faq.scratchScreenshotBody":"Yes, you can use screenshots / images of the Scratch application and website in a book or presentation, and consider them to be licensed under the {licenseLink} license.

It is available for free at https://scratch.mit.edu\".","faq.licenseLinkText":"Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike","faq.scratchDescriptionTitle":"Can I include a description of Scratch in brochures or other materials?","faq.scratchDescriptionBody":"Sure! We recommend the following description: \"Scratch is a coding  language and online community where you can create your own interactive stories, games, and animations -- and share your creations with others around the world. As young people create and share Scratch projects, they learn to think creatively, reason systematically, and work collaboratively. Scratch is a project of the {sfLink} in collaboration with the Lifelong Kindergarten group at the MIT Media Lab. It is available for free at https://scratch.mit.edu\"","faq.presentScratchTitle":"Kan jeg præsentere Scratch på en konference?","faq.presentScratchBody":"Please feel free to make presentations about Scratch to educators or other groups.","faq.supportMaterialTitle":"Må jeg bruge / remixe Scratch support materialer, sprites, billeder, lyde eller dele af projekter, som jeg har fundet på hjemmesiden?","faq.supportMaterialBody":"Yes: Most Scratch support materials on the Scratch website are available under the {licenseLink} license. There are a few exceptions: the Scratch Logo, Scratch Cat, Gobo, Pico, Nano, Giga, and Tera are Scratch trademarks, and can not be used without explicit permission from the Scratch Team.","faq.sellProjectsTitle":"Kan jeg sælge mine Scratch projekter?","faq.sellProjectsBody":"Yes: Your Scratch project is your creation. But keep in mind that once you share your project on the Scratch website, everyone is free to download, remix, and reuse the project based on the terms of the {licenseLink} license. So if you intend to sell your project, you may want to un-share it from the Scratch website.","faq.sourceCodeTitle":"Hvor kan jeg finde kildekoden for Scratch?","faq.sourceCodeBody":"The source code for the Scratch programming editor can be found on {guiLink}.

There’s a link at the bottom of every page on Scratch.","faq.reportContentTitle":"Hvad skal jeg gøre, hvis jeg ser noget som er upassende?","faq.reportContentBody":"You can click the link that says \"report\" on any project, comment, discussion post, studio, or profile page where you see something that isn't ok for Scratch. If the situation is complicated, you can use the {contactLink} link (available at the bottom of every page) to explain. Be sure to include as much detail as you can, with links to relevant pages.","faq.noFlameTitle":"Hvad gør jeg, hvis jeg ser nogen være onde eller respektløse?","faq.noFlameBody":"Lad være med at fyre op under flammerne! At svare på onde kommentarer med endnu mere onde kommentarer vil gøre tingene værre, og kan resultere i at din konto bliver blokeret. I stedet for kan du rapportere alt, som er respektløst eller ikke konstruktivt, og vi skal nok tage det op med forfatteren. Vi undersøger rapporterne hver dag, flere gange om dagen, så vær sikker på, at vi nok skal finde en løsning.","faq.reviewContentTitle":"Hvad gør Scratch teamet hvis noget er rapporteret eller markeret med et flag?","faq.reviewContentBody":"The Scratch Team reviews reported comments and projects every day. If something breaks the Scratch {cgLink}, we will remove it and send a warning to the account. We may also block the accounts or networks that were used to share it, depending on what was shared and if the person has been sent warnings before","faq.blockedAccountTitle":"Hvad sker der, når en konto er blevet blokeret?","faq.blockedAccountBody":"When an account is blocked, the owner can no longer access their account, use it to create projects, or post new comments. When they login, they see a page that explains why the account was blocked, along with a web form they can use to request to be unblocked. If the owner can show that they understand why their account was blocked, and promises to follow the Scratch {cgLink} in the future, they will be unblocked.","faq.stolenAccountTitle":"Someone got access to my account and got my account blocked. What do I do?","faq.stolenAccountBody":"You are responsible for keeping your password secure. If someone you know took control of your account and did bad things, tell the adults in charge of the computer they used. If you think someone you don’t know has access to your account, change the password and / or use the {contactLink} link to explain the situation. If your account was blocked for doing something that you did which broke the Scratch {cgLink}, please don’t tell us that someone else did it. When people tell us someone else used their account to do something bad, we then need to try and talk to that person before we can restore the account. This means your account will just stay blocked for a lot longer than if you are honest with us about what happened.","faq.aboutExtensionsTitle":"What are extensions?","faq.aboutExtensionsBody":"In the Scratch editor, you can add collections of extra blocks called \"extensions.\" For example, there are extensions that enable you to program physical devices (such as micro:bit and LEGO robotics kits) and to translate text within your Scratch projects. We will continue to add new extensions over time, so what you can do with Scratch will continue to grow over time. ","faq.howToAddExtensionsTitle":"How do I add an extension to a project?","faq.howToAddExtensionsBody":"If you click on the \"Extensions\" button in the bottom left corner of the Scratch programming editor, you will see a listing of all Scratch Extensions. When you select one of the extensions, a new category of blocks will be added to your project. The extension will be automatically loaded each time your project is opened. You can add multiple extensions to the same project.","faq.createExtensionsTitle":"How do I create my own extension for Scratch","faq.createExtensionsBody":"The Scratch Team will be publishing specifications and guidelines for extensions in the future. Once available, you will be able to submit extensions to the Scratch Team for consideration in the official Scratch 3.0 extensions library. We’ll also provide guidelines for developing and distributing \"experimental\" extensions, which can be used to create projects on individual computers, but not shared in the Scratch online community.","faq.scratchXTitle":"What will happen to the ScratchX website?","faq.scratchXBody":"The ScratchX website (scratchx.org) was an experimental testbed for extensions. Extensions created for ScratchX are not compatible with Scratch 3.0. Once experimental extensions are fully supported in Scratch we will discontinue support for ScratchX and provide developers and users time to transition off of ScratchX to the new extensions platform.","faq.cloudDataInfoTitle":"What are cloud variables?","faq.cloudDataInfoBody":"Cloud variables allow for data from a project to be saved and shared with other people in the Scratch community.

See the Accounts section (above) for more information about the transition from “New Scratcher” to \"Scratcher\".","faq.multiplayerTitle":"Is it possible to make multiplayer games with cloud variables?","faq.multiplayerBody":"Multiplayer games may be difficult to create, due to network speed and synchronization issues. However, some Scratchers are coming up with creative ways to use the cloud variables for turn-by-turn and other types of games.","faq.schoolsTitle":"Scratch i Skoler","faq.howTitle":"How is Scratch used in schools?","faq.howBody":"Scratch is used in hundreds of thousands of schools around the world, in many different subject areas (including language arts, science, history, math, and computer science).

When they login, they see a page that explains why the account was blocked, along with a web form they can use to request to be unblocked.

What do I do?","faq.stolenAccountBody":"You are responsible for keeping your password secure. If someone you know took control of your account and did bad things, tell the adults in charge of the computer they used. If you think someone you don’t know has access to your account, change the password and / or use the {contactLink} link to explain the situation. If your account was blocked for doing something that you did which broke the Scratch {cgLink}, please don’t tell us that someone else did it. When people tell us someone else used their account to do something bad, we then need to try and talk to that person before we can restore the account. This means your account will just stay blocked for a lot longer than if you are honest with us about what happened.","faq.aboutExtensionsTitle":"What are extensions?","faq.aboutExtensionsBody":"In the Scratch editor, you can add collections of extra blocks called \"extensions.\" For example, there are extensions that enable you to program physical devices (such as micro:bit and LEGO robotics kits) and to translate text within your Scratch projects.

","faq.howToAddExtensionsTitle":"How do I add an extension to a project?","faq.howToAddExtensionsBody":"If you click on the \"Extensions\" button in the bottom left corner of the Scratch programming editor, you will see a listing of all Scratch Extensions.

You can add multiple extensions to the same project.","faq.createExtensionsTitle":"How do I create my own extension for Scratch","faq.createExtensionsBody":"The Scratch Team will be publishing specifications and guidelines for extensions in the future. Once available, you will be able to submit extensions to the Scratch Team for consideration in the official Scratch 3.0 extensions library. We’ll also provide guidelines for developing and distributing \"experimental\" extensions, which can be used to create projects on individual computers, but not shared in the Scratch online community.","faq.scratchXTitle":"What will happen to the ScratchX website?","faq.scratchXBody":"The ScratchX website (scratchx.org) was an experimental testbed for extensions.

See the Accounts section (above) for more information about the transition from “New Scratcher” to \"Scratcher\".","faq.multiplayerTitle":"Is it possible to make multiplayer games with cloud variables?","faq.multiplayerBody":"Multiplayer games may be difficult to create, due to network speed and synchronization issues.

In addition, blocks are slightly bigger in Scratch 3.0 to help address issues we observed with new users having trouble clicking and dragging small interface elements.","faq.extensionsScratch3Title":"Where did the Pen blocks go? Where did the Music blocks go? Where did the Video Sensing blocks go?","faq.extensionsScratch3Body":"The Pen, Music, and Video Sensing blocks have been moved into extensions.

You’ll find tutorials for entire projects (like \"Make a Chase Game\") or specific blocks and features (such as \"Record a Sound\" or \"Make it Spin\"). More tutorials will be added soon (such as \"Pong Game\" and \"Make It Fly\").","faq.remixDefinitionTitle":"What is a remix?","faq.remixDefinitionBody":"When a Scratcher makes a copy of someone else’s project and modifies it to add their own ideas (for example, by changing scripts or costumes), the resulting project is called a \"remix\". Every project shared to the Scratch website can be remixed. We consider even a minor change to be a valid remix, as long as credit is given to the original project creator and others who made significant contributions to the remix.","faq.remixableTitle":"Why does the Scratch Team require that all projects be “remixable”?","faq.remixableBody":"We believe that remixing other people’s projects is a great way to learn to program and to create interesting projects. Through remixing, creative ideas spread through the Scratch community, and everyone benefits. All projects shared on the Scratch website are covered by the “Creative Commons Share Alike” license, which means that you can remix any project you see on the Scratch website -- and everyone else can remix any of the projects that you share on the website.","faq.creativeCommonsTitle":"What if I don’t want others to remix my projects?","faq.creativeCommonsBody":"Remixing is an important part of the Scratch community. If you don’t want others to view or remix your creations, you can still create projects on the Scratch website, but don’t share them on the website.","faq.fairUseTitle":"Can I use images / sounds / media from the internet in my projects?","faq.fairUseBody":"If you choose to integrate someone else’s work into your own, be sure to give them credit on the project “credits” section, and include a link back to the original. To find art / sounds that are already licensed for remixing, check out the {ccLink}.","faq.ccLinkText":"Creative Commons search page","faq.whyAccountTitle":"Why is it useful to have a Scratch account?","faq.whyAccountBody":"Even without an account, you can play other people’s projects, read comments and forums, and even create your own projects. But you need an account to save and share projects, write comments and forum posts, and participate in other \"social\" activities in the community (like \"loving\" other people’s projects).","faq.createAccountTitle":"How can I create an account?","faq.createAccountBody":"Just click \"Join\" on the Scratch home page. You’ll need to respond to a few questions, and provide an email address. It takes just a couple minutes, and it’s totally free!","faq.checkConfirmedTitle":"How can I check whether my account has been confirmed?","faq.howToConfirmTitle":"How do I confirm my account?","faq.howToConfirmBody":"After you create a new account on Scratch, you’ll receive an email message with a link. Just click the link to confirm your account. Once you confirm your account, you’ll be able to share projects, write comments, and create studios. Confirming your account also lets you receive email updates from the Scratch Team. If you cannot find the email with the confirmation link, check your Spam folder. If you still can’t find it, and want to receive another copy, go to your Account Settings, click the Email tab, and follow the instructions there. Please note that it may take up to an hour for the email to arrive. If you still don't see the email after an hour, {contactLink}.","faq.contactLinkText":"let us know","faq.checkConfirmedBody":"To check whether your account is confirmed, login to your Scratch account and go to your {settingsLink} page. Confirmed email addresses will show a small green checkmark. Otherwise, you will see the text \"Your email address is unconfirmed\" in orange.","faq.settingsLinkText":"Email Settings","faq.requireConfirmTitle":"Do I have to confirm my account?","faq.requireConfirmBody":"You can still use many aspects of Scratch without confirming your account, including creating and saving projects (without sharing them).","faq.forgotPasswordTitle":"I forgot my username or password.

After you’ve met the requirements, a link will appear on your profile page inviting you to become a Scratcher, and you’ll have some additional capabilities on the Scratch website. (Note that we don't promote New Scratchers to Scratcher on request )","faq.multipleAccountTitle":"האם אני יכול להחזיק ביותר מחשבון אחד?","faq.multipleAccountBody":"It's fine to have a few accounts on the Scratch website, as long as none of them are used to break the {cgLink}. In that case, all related accounts may be blocked or deleted.","faq.multipleLoginTitle":"Is it OK to have more than one person logged into an account?","faq.multipleLoginBody":"This is not allowed because the website and project editor can easily get confused when more than one person is logged in to the same account. When an account does something that violates the {cgLink}, all related accounts may be blocked or deleted. If you share an account with someone who does something bad with it, this means your accounts can be blocked for what the other person did.","faq.changeUsernameTitle":"האם אני יכול לשנות את שם המשתמש שלי?","faq.changeUsernameBody":"The structure of the Scratch website depends on having a consistent account name, so it’s not possible to change your username. If you really need to switch to a new username, you can make a new account, but you'll have to copy your projects over to the new account on your own.","faq.shareInfoTitle":"What information can I share on / with my account?","faq.shareInfoBody":"Please don’t share personal contact information, such as your physical address, email, phone number, or anything else that can be used to make contact outside of the Scratch website. Please report projects, comments, or forum posts that contain this kind of information, so the Scratch Team can remove the information, and remind the author of our policy against sharing personal contact information.","faq.deleteAccountTitle":"כיצד אני יכול למחוק את החשבון שלי?","faq.deleteAccountBody":"Login to Scratch, and then click your username in the top right-hand corner.

There are a few exceptions: the Scratch Logo, Scratch Cat, Gobo, Pico, Nano, Giga, and Tera are Scratch trademarks, and can not be used without explicit permission from the Scratch Team.","faq.sellProjectsTitle":"Can I sell my Scratch projects?","faq.sellProjectsBody":"Yes: Your Scratch project is your creation. But keep in mind that once you share your project on the Scratch website, everyone is free to download, remix, and reuse the project based on the terms of the {licenseLink} license.

Be sure to include as much detail as you can, with links to relevant pages.","faq.noFlameTitle":"What do I do if I see someone being mean or disrespectful?","faq.noFlameBody":"Don’t add to the flames! Responding to mean comments with more mean comments just makes things worse, and could result in your account being blocked. Instead, simply report anything that is disrespectful or unconstructive, and we’ll follow up with the author. We check reports every day, multiple times per day - so rest assured, we'll sort things out.","faq.reviewContentTitle":"What does the Scratch team do when something is reported or flagged?","faq.reviewContentBody":"The Scratch Team reviews reported comments and projects every day. If something breaks the Scratch {cgLink}, we will remove it and send a warning to the account. We may also block the accounts or networks that were used to share it, depending on what was shared and if the person has been sent warnings before","faq.blockedAccountTitle":"What happens when an account is blocked?","faq.blockedAccountBody":"When an account is blocked, the owner can no longer access their account, use it to create projects, or post new comments. When they login, they see a page that explains why the account was blocked, along with a web form they can use to request to be unblocked. If the owner can show that they understand why their account was blocked, and promises to follow the Scratch {cgLink} in the future, they will be unblocked.","faq.stolenAccountTitle":"Someone got access to my account and got my account blocked. What do I do?","faq.stolenAccountBody":"You are responsible for keeping your password secure. If someone you know took control of your account and did bad things, tell the adults in charge of the computer they used. If you think someone you don’t know has access to your account, change the password and / or use the {contactLink} link to explain the situation. If your account was blocked for doing something that you did which broke the Scratch {cgLink}, please don’t tell us that someone else did it. When people tell us someone else used their account to do something bad, we then need to try and talk to that person before we can restore the account. This means your account will just stay blocked for a lot longer than if you are honest with us about what happened.","faq.aboutExtensionsTitle":"What are extensions?","faq.aboutExtensionsBody":"In the Scratch editor, you can add collections of extra blocks called \"extensions.\" For example, there are extensions that enable you to program physical devices (such as micro:bit and LEGO robotics kits) and to translate text within your Scratch projects. We will continue to add new extensions over time, so what you can do with Scratch will continue to grow over time. ","faq.howToAddExtensionsTitle":"How do I add an extension to a project?","faq.howToAddExtensionsBody":"If you click on the \"Extensions\" button in the bottom left corner of the Scratch programming editor, you will see a listing of all Scratch Extensions.

You can add multiple extensions to the same project.","faq.createExtensionsTitle":"How do I create my own extension for Scratch","faq.createExtensionsBody":"The Scratch Team will be publishing specifications and guidelines for extensions in the future. Once available, you will be able to submit extensions to the Scratch Team for consideration in the official Scratch 3.0 extensions library. We’ll also provide guidelines for developing and distributing \"experimental\" extensions, which can be used to create projects on individual computers, but not shared in the Scratch online community.","faq.scratchXTitle":"What will happen to the ScratchX website?","faq.scratchXBody":"The ScratchX website (scratchx.org) was an experimental testbed for extensions. Extensions created for ScratchX are not compatible with Scratch 3.0.

In addition, blocks are slightly bigger in Scratch 3.0 to help address issues we observed with new users having trouble clicking and dragging small interface elements.","faq.extensionsScratch3Title":"Where did the Pen blocks go? Where did the Music blocks go? Where did the Video Sensing blocks go?","faq.extensionsScratch3Body":"The Pen, Music, and Video Sensing blocks have been moved into extensions.

More tutorials will be added soon (such as \"Pong Game\" and \"Make It Fly\").","faq.remixDefinitionTitle":"What is a remix?","faq.remixDefinitionBody":"When a Scratcher makes a copy of someone else’s project and modifies it to add their own ideas (for example, by changing scripts or costumes), the resulting project is called a \"remix\". Every project shared to the Scratch website can be remixed. We consider even a minor change to be a valid remix, as long as credit is given to the original project creator and others who made significant contributions to the remix.","faq.remixableTitle":"Why does the Scratch Team require that all projects be “remixable”?","faq.remixableBody":"We believe that remixing other people’s projects is a great way to learn to program and to create interesting projects. Through remixing, creative ideas spread through the Scratch community, and everyone benefits. All projects shared on the Scratch website are covered by the “Creative Commons Share Alike” license, which means that you can remix any project you see on the Scratch website -- and everyone else can remix any of the projects that you share on the website.","faq.creativeCommonsTitle":"What if I don’t want others to remix my projects?","faq.creativeCommonsBody":"Remixing is an important part of the Scratch community. If you don’t want others to view or remix your creations, you can still create projects on the Scratch website, but don’t share them on the website.","faq.fairUseTitle":"Can I use images / sounds / media from the internet in my projects?","faq.fairUseBody":"If you choose to integrate someone else’s work into your own, be sure to give them credit on the project “credits” section, and include a link back to the original. To find art / sounds that are already licensed for remixing, check out the {ccLink}.","faq.ccLinkText":"Creative Commons search page","faq.whyAccountTitle":"Why is it useful to have a Scratch account?","faq.whyAccountBody":"Even without an account, you can play other people’s projects, read comments and forums, and even create your own projects. But you need an account to save and share projects, write comments and forum posts, and participate in other \"social\" activities in the community (like \"loving\" other people’s projects).","faq.createAccountTitle":"How can I create an account?","faq.createAccountBody":"Just click \"Join\" on the Scratch home page. You’ll need to respond to a few questions, and provide an email address. It takes just a couple minutes, and it’s totally free!","faq.checkConfirmedTitle":"How can I check whether my account has been confirmed?","faq.howToConfirmTitle":"How do I confirm my account?","faq.howToConfirmBody":"After you create a new account on Scratch, you’ll receive an email message with a link. Just click the link to confirm your account. Once you confirm your account, you’ll be able to share projects, write comments, and create studios. Confirming your account also lets you receive email updates from the Scratch Team. If you cannot find the email with the confirmation link, check your Spam folder. If you still can’t find it, and want to receive another copy, go to your Account Settings, click the Email tab, and follow the instructions there. Please note that it may take up to an hour for the email to arrive. If you still don't see the email after an hour, {contactLink}.","faq.contactLinkText":"let us know","faq.checkConfirmedBody":"To check whether your account is confirmed, login to your Scratch account and go to your {settingsLink} page. Confirmed email addresses will show a small green checkmark. Otherwise, you will see the text \"Your email address is unconfirmed\" in orange.","faq.settingsLinkText":"Email Settings","faq.requireConfirmTitle":"Do I have to confirm my account?","faq.requireConfirmBody":"You can still use many aspects of Scratch without confirming your account, including creating and saving projects (without sharing them).","faq.forgotPasswordTitle":"I forgot my username or password.

After you’ve met the requirements, a link will appear on your profile page inviting you to become a Scratcher, and you’ll have some additional capabilities on the Scratch website. (Note that we don't promote New Scratchers to Scratcher on request )","faq.multipleAccountTitle":"Can I have more than one account?","faq.multipleAccountBody":"It's fine to have a few accounts on the Scratch website, as long as none of them are used to break the {cgLink}. In that case, all related accounts may be blocked or deleted.","faq.multipleLoginTitle":"Is it OK to have more than one person logged into an account?","faq.multipleLoginBody":"This is not allowed because the website and project editor can easily get confused when more than one person is logged in to the same account. When an account does something that violates the {cgLink}, all related accounts may be blocked or deleted. If you share an account with someone who does something bad with it, this means your accounts can be blocked for what the other person did.","faq.changeUsernameTitle":"Can I change my username?","faq.changeUsernameBody":"The structure of the Scratch website depends on having a consistent account name, so it’s not possible to change your username. If you really need to switch to a new username, you can make a new account, but you'll have to copy your projects over to the new account on your own.","faq.shareInfoTitle":"What information can I share on / with my account?","faq.shareInfoBody":"Please don’t share personal contact information, such as your physical address, email, phone number, or anything else that can be used to make contact outside of the Scratch website. Please report projects, comments, or forum posts that contain this kind of information, so the Scratch Team can remove the information, and remind the author of our policy against sharing personal contact information.","faq.deleteAccountTitle":"How do I delete my account?","faq.deleteAccountBody":"Login to Scratch, and then click your username in the top right-hand corner. Select \"Account Settings\", then click the \"I want to delete my account\" link at the bottom of the page. But you should only do this if you are absolutely sure that you want to delete your account.","faq.scratchFreeTitle":"Is Scratch free? Can I use it wherever I want?","faq.scratchFreeBody":"Yes! Scratch is available free of charge. You can use it in your school, and you can teach a course about it (even a course that costs money). You don't need to buy a license: it's free!","faq.scratchScreenshotTitle":"Can I use screenshots of Scratch in a book or presentation?","faq.scratchScreenshotBody":"Yes, you can use screenshots / images of the Scratch application and website in a book or presentation, and consider them to be licensed under the {licenseLink} license.

It is available for free at https://scratch.mit.edu\".","faq.licenseLinkText":"Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike","faq.scratchDescriptionTitle":"Can I include a description of Scratch in brochures or other materials?","faq.scratchDescriptionBody":"Sure! We recommend the following description: \"Scratch is a coding  language and online community where you can create your own interactive stories, games, and animations -- and share your creations with others around the world. As young people create and share Scratch projects, they learn to think creatively, reason systematically, and work collaboratively.

There are a few exceptions: the Scratch Logo, Scratch Cat, Gobo, Pico, Nano, Giga, and Tera are Scratch trademarks, and can not be used without explicit permission from the Scratch Team.","faq.sellProjectsTitle":"Can I sell my Scratch projects?","faq.sellProjectsBody":"Yes: Your Scratch project is your creation. But keep in mind that once you share your project on the Scratch website, everyone is free to download, remix, and reuse the project based on the terms of the {licenseLink} license. So if you intend to sell your project, you may want to un-share it from the Scratch website.","faq.sourceCodeTitle":"Where can I find the source code for Scratch?","faq.sourceCodeBody":"The source code for the Scratch programming editor can be found on {guiLink}. The source code for {flashLink} and {scratch14Link}, are also available on GitHub.

There’s a link at the bottom of every page on Scratch.","faq.reportContentTitle":"What do I do if I see something that’s inappropriate?","faq.reportContentBody":"You can click the link that says \"report\" on any project, comment, discussion post, studio, or profile page where you see something that isn't ok for Scratch. If the situation is complicated, you can use the {contactLink} link (available at the bottom of every page) to explain. Be sure to include as much detail as you can, with links to relevant pages.","faq.noFlameTitle":"What do I do if I see someone being mean or disrespectful?","faq.noFlameBody":"Don’t add to the flames! Responding to mean comments with more mean comments just makes things worse, and could result in your account being blocked. Instead, simply report anything that is disrespectful or unconstructive, and we’ll follow up with the author. We check reports every day, multiple times per day - so rest assured, we'll sort things out.","faq.reviewContentTitle":"What does the Scratch team do when something is reported or flagged?","faq.reviewContentBody":"The Scratch Team reviews reported comments and projects every day. If something breaks the Scratch {cgLink}, we will remove it and send a warning to the account. We may also block the accounts or networks that were used to share it, depending on what was shared and if the person has been sent warnings before","faq.blockedAccountTitle":"What happens when an account is blocked?","faq.blockedAccountBody":"When an account is blocked, the owner can no longer access their account, use it to create projects, or post new comments. When they login, they see a page that explains why the account was blocked, along with a web form they can use to request to be unblocked. If the owner can show that they understand why their account was blocked, and promises to follow the Scratch {cgLink} in the future, they will be unblocked.","faq.stolenAccountTitle":"Someone got access to my account and got my account blocked. What do I do?","faq.stolenAccountBody":"You are responsible for keeping your password secure. If someone you know took control of your account and did bad things, tell the adults in charge of the computer they used. If you think someone you don’t know has access to your account, change the password and / or use the {contactLink} link to explain the situation. If your account was blocked for doing something that you did which broke the Scratch {cgLink}, please don’t tell us that someone else did it. When people tell us someone else used their account to do something bad, we then need to try and talk to that person before we can restore the account. This means your account will just stay blocked for a lot longer than if you are honest with us about what happened.","faq.aboutExtensionsTitle":"What are extensions?","faq.aboutExtensionsBody":"In the Scratch editor, you can add collections of extra blocks called \"extensions.\" For example, there are extensions that enable you to program physical devices (such as micro:bit and LEGO robotics kits) and to translate text within your Scratch projects. We will continue to add new extensions over time, so what you can do with Scratch will continue to grow over time. ","faq.howToAddExtensionsTitle":"How do I add an extension to a project?","faq.howToAddExtensionsBody":"If you click on the \"Extensions\" button in the bottom left corner of the Scratch programming editor, you will see a listing of all Scratch Extensions. When you select one of the extensions, a new category of blocks will be added to your project. The extension will be automatically loaded each time your project is opened. You can add multiple extensions to the same project.","faq.createExtensionsTitle":"How do I create my own extension for Scratch","faq.createExtensionsBody":"The Scratch Team will be publishing specifications and guidelines for extensions in the future. Once available, you will be able to submit extensions to the Scratch Team for consideration in the official Scratch 3.0 extensions library. We’ll also provide guidelines for developing and distributing \"experimental\" extensions, which can be used to create projects on individual computers, but not shared in the Scratch online community.","faq.scratchXTitle":"What will happen to the ScratchX website?","faq.scratchXBody":"The ScratchX website (scratchx.org) was an experimental testbed for extensions. Extensions created for ScratchX are not compatible with Scratch 3.0. Once experimental extensions are fully supported in Scratch we will discontinue support for ScratchX and provide developers and users time to transition off of ScratchX to the new extensions platform.","faq.cloudDataInfoTitle":"What are cloud variables?","faq.cloudDataInfoBody":"Cloud variables allow for data from a project to be saved and shared with other people in the Scratch community. You can use cloud variables to make surveys and other projects where others in the community to access and modify the data over time.","faq.makeCloudVarTitle":"How can I make a cloud variable?","faq.makeCloudVarBody":"Go to the \"Variables\" section of the blocks palette, select \"Make a Variable\", and then click the checkbox next to \"Cloud variable (stored on server)\".

After you’ve met the requirements, a link will appear on your profile page inviting you to become a Scratcher, and you’ll have some additional capabilities on the Scratch website. (Note that we don't promote New Scratchers to Scratcher on request )","faq.multipleAccountTitle":"Can I have more than one account?","faq.multipleAccountBody":"It's fine to have a few accounts on the Scratch website, as long as none of them are used to break the {cgLink}. In that case, all related accounts may be blocked or deleted.","faq.multipleLoginTitle":"Is it OK to have more than one person logged into an account?","faq.multipleLoginBody":"This is not allowed because the website and project editor can easily get confused when more than one person is logged in to the same account. When an account does something that violates the {cgLink}, all related accounts may be blocked or deleted. If you share an account with someone who does something bad with it, this means your accounts can be blocked for what the other person did.","faq.changeUsernameTitle":"Can I change my username?","faq.changeUsernameBody":"The structure of the Scratch website depends on having a consistent account name, so it’s not possible to change your username. If you really need to switch to a new username, you can make a new account, but you'll have to copy your projects over to the new account on your own.","faq.shareInfoTitle":"What information can I share on / with my account?","faq.shareInfoBody":"Please don’t share personal contact information, such as your physical address, email, phone number, or anything else that can be used to make contact outside of the Scratch website.

It is available for free at https://scratch.mit.edu\".","faq.licenseLinkText":"Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike","faq.scratchDescriptionTitle":"Can I include a description of Scratch in brochures or other materials?","faq.scratchDescriptionBody":"Sure! We recommend the following description: \"Scratch is a coding  language and online community where you can create your own interactive stories, games, and animations -- and share your creations with others around the world. As young people create and share Scratch projects, they learn to think creatively, reason systematically, and work collaboratively. Scratch is a project of the {sfLink} in collaboration with the Lifelong Kindergarten group at the MIT Media Lab. It is available for free at https://scratch.mit.edu\"","faq.presentScratchTitle":"Can I present Scratch at a conference?","faq.presentScratchBody":"Please feel free to make presentations about Scratch to educators or other groups.","faq.supportMaterialTitle":"May I use / remix Scratch support materials, sprites, images, sounds or sample projects I’ve found on the website?","faq.supportMaterialBody":"Yes: Most Scratch support materials on the Scratch website are available under the {licenseLink} license.

If the situation is complicated, you can use the {contactLink} link (available at the bottom of every page) to explain. Be sure to include as much detail as you can, with links to relevant pages.","faq.noFlameTitle":"What do I do if I see someone being mean or disrespectful?","faq.noFlameBody":"Don’t add to the flames! Responding to mean comments with more mean comments just makes things worse, and could result in your account being blocked. Instead, simply report anything that is disrespectful or unconstructive, and we’ll follow up with the author. We check reports every day, multiple times per day - so rest assured, we'll sort things out.","faq.reviewContentTitle":"What does the Scratch team do when something is reported or flagged?","faq.reviewContentBody":"The Scratch Team reviews reported comments and projects every day. If something breaks the Scratch {cgLink}, we will remove it and send a warning to the account. We may also block the accounts or networks that were used to share it, depending on what was shared and if the person has been sent warnings before","faq.blockedAccountTitle":"What happens when an account is blocked?","faq.blockedAccountBody":"When an account is blocked, the owner can no longer access their account, use it to create projects, or post new comments. When they login, they see a page that explains why the account was blocked, along with a web form they can use to request to be unblocked. If the owner can show that they understand why their account was blocked, and promises to follow the Scratch {cgLink} in the future, they will be unblocked.","faq.stolenAccountTitle":"Someone got access to my account and got my account blocked. What do I do?","faq.stolenAccountBody":"You are responsible for keeping your password secure. If someone you know took control of your account and did bad things, tell the adults in charge of the computer they used. If you think someone you don’t know has access to your account, change the password and / or use the {contactLink} link to explain the situation. If your account was blocked for doing something that you did which broke the Scratch {cgLink}, please don’t tell us that someone else did it. When people tell us someone else used their account to do something bad, we then need to try and talk to that person before we can restore the account. This means your account will just stay blocked for a lot longer than if you are honest with us about what happened.","faq.aboutExtensionsTitle":"What are extensions?","faq.aboutExtensionsBody":"In the Scratch editor, you can add collections of extra blocks called \"extensions.\" For example, there are extensions that enable you to program physical devices (such as micro:bit and LEGO robotics kits) and to translate text within your Scratch projects. We will continue to add new extensions over time, so what you can do with Scratch will continue to grow over time. ","faq.howToAddExtensionsTitle":"How do I add an extension to a project?","faq.howToAddExtensionsBody":"If you click on the \"Extensions\" button in the bottom left corner of the Scratch programming editor, you will see a listing of all Scratch Extensions. When you select one of the extensions, a new category of blocks will be added to your project. The extension will be automatically loaded each time your project is opened. You can add multiple extensions to the same project.","faq.createExtensionsTitle":"How do I create my own extension for Scratch","faq.createExtensionsBody":"The Scratch Team will be publishing specifications and guidelines for extensions in the future. Once available, you will be able to submit extensions to the Scratch Team for consideration in the official Scratch 3.0 extensions library. We’ll also provide guidelines for developing and distributing \"experimental\" extensions, which can be used to create projects on individual computers, but not shared in the Scratch online community.","faq.scratchXTitle":"What will happen to the ScratchX website?","faq.scratchXBody":"The ScratchX website (scratchx.org) was an experimental testbed for extensions. Extensions created for ScratchX are not compatible with Scratch 3.0. Once experimental extensions are fully supported in Scratch we will discontinue support for ScratchX and provide developers and users time to transition off of ScratchX to the new extensions platform.","faq.cloudDataInfoTitle":"What are cloud variables?","faq.cloudDataInfoBody":"Cloud variables allow for data from a project to be saved and shared with other people in the Scratch community.

If people \"see inside\" or remix your code, it creates a copy of the variable and does not affect or change the original variable.","faq.newScratcherCloudTitle":"I am logged in, but I cannot use projects with cloud variables What is going on?","faq.newScratcherCloudBody":"If you are still a \"New Scratcher\" on the website, you will not be able to use projects with cloud variables. You need to become a \"Scratcher\" to have access to cloud variables. See the Accounts section (above) for more information about the transition from “New Scratcher” to \"Scratcher\".","faq.multiplayerTitle":"Is it possible to make multiplayer games with cloud variables?","faq.multiplayerBody":"Multiplayer games may be difficult to create, due to network speed and synchronization issues. However, some Scratchers are coming up with creative ways to use the cloud variables for turn-by-turn and other types of games.","faq.schoolsTitle":"Scratch í skólum","faq.howTitle":"How is Scratch used in schools?","faq.howBody":"Scratch is used in hundreds of thousands of schools around the world, in many different subject areas (including language arts, science, history, math, and computer science).

This means your account will just stay blocked for a lot longer than if you are honest with us about what happened.","faq.aboutExtensionsTitle":"What are extensions?","faq.aboutExtensionsBody":"In the Scratch editor, you can add collections of extra blocks called \"extensions.\" For example, there are extensions that enable you to program physical devices (such as micro:bit and LEGO robotics kits) and to translate text within your Scratch projects.

In addition, blocks are slightly bigger in Scratch 3.0 to help address issues we observed with new users having trouble clicking and dragging small interface elements.","faq.extensionsScratch3Title":"Where did the Pen blocks go? Where did the Music blocks go? Where did the Video Sensing blocks go?","faq.extensionsScratch3Body":"The Pen, Music, and Video Sensing blocks have been moved into extensions.

More tutorials will be added soon (such as \"Pong Game\" and \"Make It Fly\").","faq.remixDefinitionTitle":"What is a remix?","faq.remixDefinitionBody":"When a Scratcher makes a copy of someone else’s project and modifies it to add their own ideas (for example, by changing scripts or costumes), the resulting project is called a \"remix\". Every project shared to the Scratch website can be remixed. We consider even a minor change to be a valid remix, as long as credit is given to the original project creator and others who made significant contributions to the remix.","faq.remixableTitle":"Why does the Scratch Team require that all projects be “remixable”?","faq.remixableBody":"We believe that remixing other people’s projects is a great way to learn to program and to create interesting projects. Through remixing, creative ideas spread through the Scratch community, and everyone benefits. All projects shared on the Scratch website are covered by the “Creative Commons Share Alike” license, which means that you can remix any project you see on the Scratch website -- and everyone else can remix any of the projects that you share on the website.","faq.creativeCommonsTitle":"What if I don’t want others to remix my projects?","faq.creativeCommonsBody":"Remixing is an important part of the Scratch community. If you don’t want others to view or remix your creations, you can still create projects on the Scratch website, but don’t share them on the website.","faq.fairUseTitle":"Can I use images / sounds / media from the internet in my projects?","faq.fairUseBody":"If you choose to integrate someone else’s work into your own, be sure to give them credit on the project “credits” section, and include a link back to the original. To find art / sounds that are already licensed for remixing, check out the {ccLink}.","faq.ccLinkText":"Creative Commons search page","faq.whyAccountTitle":"Why is it useful to have a Scratch account?","faq.whyAccountBody":"Even without an account, you can play other people’s projects, read comments and forums, and even create your own projects. But you need an account to save and share projects, write comments and forum posts, and participate in other \"social\" activities in the community (like \"loving\" other people’s projects).","faq.createAccountTitle":"How can I create an account?","faq.createAccountBody":"Just click \"Join\" on the Scratch home page. You’ll need to respond to a few questions, and provide an email address. It takes just a couple minutes, and it’s totally free!","faq.checkConfirmedTitle":"How can I check whether my account has been confirmed?","faq.howToConfirmTitle":"How do I confirm my account?","faq.howToConfirmBody":"After you create a new account on Scratch, you’ll receive an email message with a link. Just click the link to confirm your account. Once you confirm your account, you’ll be able to share projects, write comments, and create studios. Confirming your account also lets you receive email updates from the Scratch Team. If you cannot find the email with the confirmation link, check your Spam folder. If you still can’t find it, and want to receive another copy, go to your Account Settings, click the Email tab, and follow the instructions there. Please note that it may take up to an hour for the email to arrive. If you still don't see the email after an hour, {contactLink}.","faq.contactLinkText":"let us know","faq.checkConfirmedBody":"To check whether your account is confirmed, login to your Scratch account and go to your {settingsLink} page.

After you’ve met the requirements, a link will appear on your profile page inviting you to become a Scratcher, and you’ll have some additional capabilities on the Scratch website. (Note that we don't promote New Scratchers to Scratcher on request )","faq.multipleAccountTitle":"Can I have more than one account?","faq.multipleAccountBody":"It's fine to have a few accounts on the Scratch website, as long as none of them are used to break the {cgLink}. In that case, all related accounts may be blocked or deleted.","faq.multipleLoginTitle":"Is it OK to have more than one person logged into an account?","faq.multipleLoginBody":"This is not allowed because the website and project editor can easily get confused when more than one person is logged in to the same account. When an account does something that violates the {cgLink}, all related accounts may be blocked or deleted. If you share an account with someone who does something bad with it, this means your accounts can be blocked for what the other person did.","faq.changeUsernameTitle":"Can I change my username?","faq.changeUsernameBody":"The structure of the Scratch website depends on having a consistent account name, so it’s not possible to change your username. If you really need to switch to a new username, you can make a new account, but you'll have to copy your projects over to the new account on your own.","faq.shareInfoTitle":"What information can I share on / with my account?","faq.shareInfoBody":"Please don’t share personal contact information, such as your physical address, email, phone number, or anything else that can be used to make contact outside of the Scratch website. Please report projects, comments, or forum posts that contain this kind of information, so the Scratch Team can remove the information, and remind the author of our policy against sharing personal contact information.","faq.deleteAccountTitle":"How do I delete my account?","faq.deleteAccountBody":"Login to Scratch, and then click your username in the top right-hand corner. Select \"Account Settings\", then click the \"I want to delete my account\" link at the bottom of the page. But you should only do this if you are absolutely sure that you want to delete your account.","faq.scratchFreeTitle":"Is Scratch free? Can I use it wherever I want?","faq.scratchFreeBody":"Yes! Scratch is available free of charge. You can use it in your school, and you can teach a course about it (even a course that costs money). You don't need to buy a license: it's free!","faq.scratchScreenshotTitle":"Can I use screenshots of Scratch in a book or presentation?","faq.scratchScreenshotBody":"Yes, you can use screenshots / images of the Scratch application and website in a book or presentation, and consider them to be licensed under the {licenseLink} license.

There are a few exceptions: the Scratch Logo, Scratch Cat, Gobo, Pico, Nano, Giga, and Tera are Scratch trademarks, and can not be used without explicit permission from the Scratch Team.","faq.sellProjectsTitle":"Can I sell my Scratch projects?","faq.sellProjectsBody":"Yes: Your Scratch project is your creation. But keep in mind that once you share your project on the Scratch website, everyone is free to download, remix, and reuse the project based on the terms of the {licenseLink} license. So if you intend to sell your project, you may want to un-share it from the Scratch website.","faq.sourceCodeTitle":"Where can I find the source code for Scratch?","faq.sourceCodeBody":"The source code for the Scratch programming editor can be found on {guiLink}.

There’s a link at the bottom of every page on Scratch.","faq.reportContentTitle":"What do I do if I see something that’s inappropriate?","faq.reportContentBody":"You can click the link that says \"report\" on any project, comment, discussion post, studio, or profile page where you see something that isn't ok for Scratch. If the situation is complicated, you can use the {contactLink} link (available at the bottom of every page) to explain. Be sure to include as much detail as you can, with links to relevant pages.","faq.noFlameTitle":"What do I do if I see someone being mean or disrespectful?","faq.noFlameBody":"Don’t add to the flames! Responding to mean comments with more mean comments just makes things worse, and could result in your account being blocked. Instead, simply report anything that is disrespectful or unconstructive, and we’ll follow up with the author. We check reports every day, multiple times per day - so rest assured, we'll sort things out.","faq.reviewContentTitle":"What does the Scratch team do when something is reported or flagged?","faq.reviewContentBody":"The Scratch Team reviews reported comments and projects every day. If something breaks the Scratch {cgLink}, we will remove it and send a warning to the account.

If your account was blocked for doing something that you did which broke the Scratch {cgLink}, please don’t tell us that someone else did it. When people tell us someone else used their account to do something bad, we then need to try and talk to that person before we can restore the account. This means your account will just stay blocked for a lot longer than if you are honest with us about what happened.","faq.aboutExtensionsTitle":"What are extensions?","faq.aboutExtensionsBody":"In the Scratch editor, you can add collections of extra blocks called \"extensions.\" For example, there are extensions that enable you to program physical devices (such as micro:bit and LEGO robotics kits) and to translate text within your Scratch projects.

Once available, you will be able to submit extensions to the Scratch Team for consideration in the official Scratch 3.0 extensions library. We’ll also provide guidelines for developing and distributing \"experimental\" extensions, which can be used to create projects on individual computers, but not shared in the Scratch online community.","faq.scratchXTitle":"What will happen to the ScratchX website?","faq.scratchXBody":"The ScratchX website (scratchx.org) was an experimental testbed for extensions. Extensions created for ScratchX are not compatible with Scratch 3.0. Once experimental extensions are fully supported in Scratch we will discontinue support for ScratchX and provide developers and users time to transition off of ScratchX to the new extensions platform.","faq.cloudDataInfoTitle":"What are cloud variables?","faq.cloudDataInfoBody":"Cloud variables allow for data from a project to be saved and shared with other people in the Scratch community.

In Scratch 3.0 you’ll find:","faq.newBlocksSoundEffect":"New \"sound effect\" blocks","faq.newBlocksOperators":"New operators that make it easier to work with text (strings)","faq.newBlocksPen":"New pen blocks, including support for transparency","faq.newBlocksGlide":"New glide block to move easily to a sprite (or random point)","faq.newBlocksExtensions":"Many new capabilities through \"Scratch Extensions\" (see the Extensions section below)","faq.biggerBlocksScratch3Title":"Why are the blocks bigger in Scratch 3.0 than in earlier versions?","faq.biggerBlocksScratch3Body":"In order to make Scratch 3.0 work well on touch devices (like many Chromebooks, Windows Surface laptops, and tablets), we needed to make the blocks bigger, so that it’s easier to drag and tap the blocks. In addition, blocks are slightly bigger in Scratch 3.0 to help address issues we observed with new users having trouble clicking and dragging small interface elements.","faq.extensionsScratch3Title":"Where did the Pen blocks go? Where did the Music blocks go? Where did the Video Sensing blocks go?","faq.extensionsScratch3Body":"The Pen, Music, and Video Sensing blocks have been moved into extensions.

You’ll find tutorials for entire projects (like \"Make a Chase Game\") or specific blocks and features (such as \"Record a Sound\" or \"Make it Spin\"). More tutorials will be added soon (such as \"Pong Game\" and \"Make It Fly\").","faq.remixDefinitionTitle":"Mi egy remix?","faq.remixDefinitionBody":"When a Scratcher makes a copy of someone else’s project and modifies it to add their own ideas (for example, by changing scripts or costumes), the resulting project is called a \"remix\". Every project shared to the Scratch website can be remixed. We consider even a minor change to be a valid remix, as long as credit is given to the original project creator and others who made significant contributions to the remix.","faq.remixableTitle":"Miért kell minden projekt remixelhető legyen?","faq.remixableBody":"We believe that remixing other people’s projects is a great way to learn to program and to create interesting projects. Through remixing, creative ideas spread through the Scratch community, and everyone benefits.

Just click the link to confirm your account. Once you confirm your account, you’ll be able to share projects, write comments, and create studios. Confirming your account also lets you receive email updates from the Scratch Team. If you cannot find the email with the confirmation link, check your Spam folder. If you still can’t find it, and want to receive another copy, go to your Account Settings, click the Email tab, and follow the instructions there. Please note that it may take up to an hour for the email to arrive. If you still don't see the email after an hour, {contactLink}.","faq.contactLinkText":"let us know","faq.checkConfirmedBody":"To check whether your account is confirmed, login to your Scratch account and go to your {settingsLink} page.

After you’ve met the requirements, a link will appear on your profile page inviting you to become a Scratcher, and you’ll have some additional capabilities on the Scratch website. (Note that we don't promote New Scratchers to Scratcher on request )","faq.multipleAccountTitle":"Lehet-e több, mint egy fiókom?","faq.multipleAccountBody":"It's fine to have a few accounts on the Scratch website, as long as none of them are used to break the {cgLink}. In that case, all related accounts may be blocked or deleted.","faq.multipleLoginTitle":"Lehetnek-e egyszerre többen bejelentkezve ugyabba a fiókba?","faq.multipleLoginBody":"This is not allowed because the website and project editor can easily get confused when more than one person is logged in to the same account. When an account does something that violates the {cgLink}, all related accounts may be blocked or deleted. If you share an account with someone who does something bad with it, this means your accounts can be blocked for what the other person did.","faq.changeUsernameTitle":"Miként változtathatom meg a felhasználónevem?","faq.changeUsernameBody":"The structure of the Scratch website depends on having a consistent account name, so it’s not possible to change your username. If you really need to switch to a new username, you can make a new account, but you'll have to copy your projects over to the new account on your own.","faq.shareInfoTitle":"Milyen információkat oszthatok meg a fiókomon?","faq.shareInfoBody":"Please don’t share personal contact information, such as your physical address, email, phone number, or anything else that can be used to make contact outside of the Scratch website. Please report projects, comments, or forum posts that contain this kind of information, so the Scratch Team can remove the information, and remind the author of our policy against sharing personal contact information.","faq.deleteAccountTitle":"Hogyan törölhetem a fiókomat?","faq.deleteAccountBody":"Login to Scratch, and then click your username in the top right-hand corner.

Be sure to include as much detail as you can, with links to relevant pages.","faq.noFlameTitle":"What do I do if I see someone being mean or disrespectful?","faq.noFlameBody":"Don’t add to the flames! Responding to mean comments with more mean comments just makes things worse, and could result in your account being blocked. Instead, simply report anything that is disrespectful or unconstructive, and we’ll follow up with the author. We check reports every day, multiple times per day - so rest assured, we'll sort things out.","faq.reviewContentTitle":"What does the Scratch team do when something is reported or flagged?","faq.reviewContentBody":"The Scratch Team reviews reported comments and projects every day. If something breaks the Scratch {cgLink}, we will remove it and send a warning to the account. We may also block the accounts or networks that were used to share it, depending on what was shared and if the person has been sent warnings before","faq.blockedAccountTitle":"What happens when an account is blocked?","faq.blockedAccountBody":"When an account is blocked, the owner can no longer access their account, use it to create projects, or post new comments. When they login, they see a page that explains why the account was blocked, along with a web form they can use to request to be unblocked. If the owner can show that they understand why their account was blocked, and promises to follow the Scratch {cgLink} in the future, they will be unblocked.","faq.stolenAccountTitle":"Someone got access to my account and got my account blocked. What do I do?","faq.stolenAccountBody":"You are responsible for keeping your password secure. If someone you know took control of your account and did bad things, tell the adults in charge of the computer they used. If you think someone you don’t know has access to your account, change the password and / or use the {contactLink} link to explain the situation. If your account was blocked for doing something that you did which broke the Scratch {cgLink}, please don’t tell us that someone else did it. When people tell us someone else used their account to do something bad, we then need to try and talk to that person before we can restore the account. This means your account will just stay blocked for a lot longer than if you are honest with us about what happened.","faq.aboutExtensionsTitle":"What are extensions?","faq.aboutExtensionsBody":"In the Scratch editor, you can add collections of extra blocks called \"extensions.\" For example, there are extensions that enable you to program physical devices (such as micro:bit and LEGO robotics kits) and to translate text within your Scratch projects. We will continue to add new extensions over time, so what you can do with Scratch will continue to grow over time. ","faq.howToAddExtensionsTitle":"How do I add an extension to a project?","faq.howToAddExtensionsBody":"If you click on the \"Extensions\" button in the bottom left corner of the Scratch programming editor, you will see a listing of all Scratch Extensions.

You can add multiple extensions to the same project.","faq.createExtensionsTitle":"How do I create my own extension for Scratch","faq.createExtensionsBody":"The Scratch Team will be publishing specifications and guidelines for extensions in the future. Once available, you will be able to submit extensions to the Scratch Team for consideration in the official Scratch 3.0 extensions library. We’ll also provide guidelines for developing and distributing \"experimental\" extensions, which can be used to create projects on individual computers, but not shared in the Scratch online community.","faq.scratchXTitle":"What will happen to the ScratchX website?","faq.scratchXBody":"The ScratchX website (scratchx.org) was an experimental testbed for extensions. Extensions created for ScratchX are not compatible with Scratch 3.0.

In that case, all related accounts may be blocked or deleted.","faq.multipleLoginTitle":"Er det greitt at fleire loggar seg inn på same brukarkonto?","faq.multipleLoginBody":"This is not allowed because the website and project editor can easily get confused when more than one person is logged in to the same account. When an account does something that violates the {cgLink}, all related accounts may be blocked or deleted. If you share an account with someone who does something bad with it, this means your accounts can be blocked for what the other person did.","faq.changeUsernameTitle":"Kan eg byta til eit anna brukarnamn?","faq.changeUsernameBody":"The structure of the Scratch website depends on having a consistent account name, so it’s not possible to change your username.

Me sjekkar meldingar mange gongar om dagen, så du kan vera sikker på at me ordnar opp.","faq.reviewContentTitle":"Kva gjer administratorane når noko vert meldt inn?","faq.reviewContentBody":"The Scratch Team reviews reported comments and projects every day.

When they login, they see a page that explains why the account was blocked, along with a web form they can use to request to be unblocked. If the owner can show that they understand why their account was blocked, and promises to follow the Scratch {cgLink} in the future, they will be unblocked.","faq.stolenAccountTitle":"Someone got access to my account and got my account blocked. What do I do?","faq.stolenAccountBody":"You are responsible for keeping your password secure. If someone you know took control of your account and did bad things, tell the adults in charge of the computer they used. If you think someone you don’t know has access to your account, change the password and / or use the {contactLink} link to explain the situation. If your account was blocked for doing something that you did which broke the Scratch {cgLink}, please don’t tell us that someone else did it. When people tell us someone else used their account to do something bad, we then need to try and talk to that person before we can restore the account. This means your account will just stay blocked for a lot longer than if you are honest with us about what happened.","faq.aboutExtensionsTitle":"What are extensions?","faq.aboutExtensionsBody":"In the Scratch editor, you can add collections of extra blocks called \"extensions.\" For example, there are extensions that enable you to program physical devices (such as micro:bit and LEGO robotics kits) and to translate text within your Scratch projects. We will continue to add new extensions over time, so what you can do with Scratch will continue to grow over time. ","faq.howToAddExtensionsTitle":"How do I add an extension to a project?","faq.howToAddExtensionsBody":"If you click on the \"Extensions\" button in the bottom left corner of the Scratch programming editor, you will see a listing of all Scratch Extensions.

You can add multiple extensions to the same project.","faq.createExtensionsTitle":"How do I create my own extension for Scratch","faq.createExtensionsBody":"The Scratch Team will be publishing specifications and guidelines for extensions in the future. Once available, you will be able to submit extensions to the Scratch Team for consideration in the official Scratch 3.0 extensions library.

(Note that we don't promote New Scratchers to Scratcher on request )","faq.multipleAccountTitle":"Can I have more than one account?","faq.multipleAccountBody":"It's fine to have a few accounts on the Scratch website, as long as none of them are used to break the {cgLink}. In that case, all related accounts may be blocked or deleted.","faq.multipleLoginTitle":"Is it OK to have more than one person logged into an account?","faq.multipleLoginBody":"This is not allowed because the website and project editor can easily get confused when more than one person is logged in to the same account. When an account does something that violates the {cgLink}, all related accounts may be blocked or deleted. If you share an account with someone who does something bad with it, this means your accounts can be blocked for what the other person did.","faq.changeUsernameTitle":"Can I change my username?","faq.changeUsernameBody":"The structure of the Scratch website depends on having a consistent account name, so it’s not possible to change your username. If you really need to switch to a new username, you can make a new account, but you'll have to copy your projects over to the new account on your own.","faq.shareInfoTitle":"What information can I share on / with my account?","faq.shareInfoBody":"Please don’t share personal contact information, such as your physical address, email, phone number, or anything else that can be used to make contact outside of the Scratch website.

When they login, they see a page that explains why the account was blocked, along with a web form they can use to request to be unblocked. If the owner can show that they understand why their account was blocked, and promises to follow the Scratch {cgLink} in the future, they will be unblocked.","faq.stolenAccountTitle":"Someone got access to my account and got my account blocked. What do I do?","faq.stolenAccountBody":"You are responsible for keeping your password secure. If someone you know took control of your account and did bad things, tell the adults in charge of the computer they used. If you think someone you don’t know has access to your account, change the password and / or use the {contactLink} link to explain the situation. If your account was blocked for doing something that you did which broke the Scratch {cgLink}, please don’t tell us that someone else did it. When people tell us someone else used their account to do something bad, we then need to try and talk to that person before we can restore the account. This means your account will just stay blocked for a lot longer than if you are honest with us about what happened.","faq.aboutExtensionsTitle":"What are extensions?","faq.aboutExtensionsBody":"In the Scratch editor, you can add collections of extra blocks called \"extensions.\" For example, there are extensions that enable you to program physical devices (such as micro:bit and LEGO robotics kits) and to translate text within your Scratch projects.

In addition, blocks are slightly bigger in Scratch 3.0 to help address issues we observed with new users having trouble clicking and dragging small interface elements.","faq.extensionsScratch3Title":"Where did the Pen blocks go? Where did the Music blocks go? Where did the Video Sensing blocks go?","faq.extensionsScratch3Body":"The Pen, Music, and Video Sensing blocks have been moved into extensions.

You’ll find tutorials for entire projects (like \"Make a Chase Game\") or specific blocks and features (such as \"Record a Sound\" or \"Make it Spin\"). More tutorials will be added soon (such as \"Pong Game\" and \"Make It Fly\").","faq.remixDefinitionTitle":"What is a remix?","faq.remixDefinitionBody":"When a Scratcher makes a copy of someone else’s project and modifies it to add their own ideas (for example, by changing scripts or costumes), the resulting project is called a \"remix\". Every project shared to the Scratch website can be remixed. We consider even a minor change to be a valid remix, as long as credit is given to the original project creator and others who made significant contributions to the remix.","faq.remixableTitle":"Why does the Scratch Team require that all projects be “remixable”?","faq.remixableBody":"We believe that remixing other people’s projects is a great way to learn to program and to create interesting projects. Through remixing, creative ideas spread through the Scratch community, and everyone benefits. All projects shared on the Scratch website are covered by the “Creative Commons Share Alike” license, which means that you can remix any project you see on the Scratch website -- and everyone else can remix any of the projects that you share on the website.","faq.creativeCommonsTitle":"What if I don’t want others to remix my projects?","faq.creativeCommonsBody":"Remixing is an important part of the Scratch community. If you don’t want others to view or remix your creations, you can still create projects on the Scratch website, but don’t share them on the website.","faq.fairUseTitle":"Can I use images / sounds / media from the internet in my projects?","faq.fairUseBody":"If you choose to integrate someone else’s work into your own, be sure to give them credit on the project “credits” section, and include a link back to the original. To find art / sounds that are already licensed for remixing, check out the {ccLink}.","faq.ccLinkText":"Creative Commons search page","faq.whyAccountTitle":"Why is it useful to have a Scratch account?","faq.whyAccountBody":"Even without an account, you can play other people’s projects, read comments and forums, and even create your own projects. But you need an account to save and share projects, write comments and forum posts, and participate in other \"social\" activities in the community (like \"loving\" other people’s projects).","faq.createAccountTitle":"How can I create an account?","faq.createAccountBody":"Just click \"Join\" on the Scratch home page. You’ll need to respond to a few questions, and provide an email address. It takes just a couple minutes, and it’s totally free!","faq.checkConfirmedTitle":"How can I check whether my account has been confirmed?","faq.howToConfirmTitle":"How do I confirm my account?","faq.howToConfirmBody":"After you create a new account on Scratch, you’ll receive an email message with a link. Just click the link to confirm your account. Once you confirm your account, you’ll be able to share projects, write comments, and create studios. Confirming your account also lets you receive email updates from the Scratch Team. If you cannot find the email with the confirmation link, check your Spam folder. If you still can’t find it, and want to receive another copy, go to your Account Settings, click the Email tab, and follow the instructions there. Please note that it may take up to an hour for the email to arrive. If you still don't see the email after an hour, {contactLink}.","faq.contactLinkText":"let us know","faq.checkConfirmedBody":"To check whether your account is confirmed, login to your Scratch account and go to your {settingsLink} page. Confirmed email addresses will show a small green checkmark. Otherwise, you will see the text \"Your email address is unconfirmed\" in orange.","faq.settingsLinkText":"Email Settings","faq.requireConfirmTitle":"Do I have to confirm my account?","faq.requireConfirmBody":"You can still use many aspects of Scratch without confirming your account, including creating and saving projects (without sharing them).","faq.forgotPasswordTitle":"I forgot my username or password. How can I reset it?","faq.forgotPasswordBody":"Enter your username or email address on the {resetLink} page. The website will send an email to the address associated with your username and a link you can use to reset your password.","faq.resetLinkText":"Password Reset","faq.changePasswordTitle":"How do I change my password?","faq.changePasswordBody":"Login to your Scratch account, then visit our {changeLink} page where you can change your password.","faq.changeLinkText":"Password Settings","faq.changeEmailTitle":"How do I change my email address?","faq.changeEmailBody":"Login to your Scratch account, then visit our {changeEmailLink} page where you can change your email address.","faq.newScratcherTitle":"How do I transition from 'New Scratcher' to 'Scratcher'?","faq.newScratcherBody":"When you create an account, you’ll be labelled as a “New Scratcher.” To make the transition to \"Scratcher\", you should make and share projects, comment helpfully on other Scratchers’ projects, and be patient! After you’ve met the requirements, a link will appear on your profile page inviting you to become a Scratcher, and you’ll have some additional capabilities on the Scratch website. (Note that we don't promote New Scratchers to Scratcher on request )","faq.multipleAccountTitle":"Can I have more than one account?","faq.multipleAccountBody":"It's fine to have a few accounts on the Scratch website, as long as none of them are used to break the {cgLink}. In that case, all related accounts may be blocked or deleted.","faq.multipleLoginTitle":"Is it OK to have more than one person logged into an account?","faq.multipleLoginBody":"This is not allowed because the website and project editor can easily get confused when more than one person is logged in to the same account. When an account does something that violates the {cgLink}, all related accounts may be blocked or deleted. If you share an account with someone who does something bad with it, this means your accounts can be blocked for what the other person did.","faq.changeUsernameTitle":"Can I change my username?","faq.changeUsernameBody":"The structure of the Scratch website depends on having a consistent account name, so it’s not possible to change your username. If you really need to switch to a new username, you can make a new account, but you'll have to copy your projects over to the new account on your own.","faq.shareInfoTitle":"What information can I share on / with my account?","faq.shareInfoBody":"Please don’t share personal contact information, such as your physical address, email, phone number, or anything else that can be used to make contact outside of the Scratch website. Please report projects, comments, or forum posts that contain this kind of information, so the Scratch Team can remove the information, and remind the author of our policy against sharing personal contact information.","faq.deleteAccountTitle":"How do I delete my account?","faq.deleteAccountBody":"Login to Scratch, and then click your username in the top right-hand corner. Select \"Account Settings\", then click the \"I want to delete my account\" link at the bottom of the page. But you should only do this if you are absolutely sure that you want to delete your account.","faq.scratchFreeTitle":"Is Scratch free? Can I use it wherever I want?","faq.scratchFreeBody":"Yes!

There are a few exceptions: the Scratch Logo, Scratch Cat, Gobo, Pico, Nano, Giga, and Tera are Scratch trademarks, and can not be used without explicit permission from the Scratch Team.","faq.sellProjectsTitle":"Can I sell my Scratch projects?","faq.sellProjectsBody":"Yes: Your Scratch project is your creation. But keep in mind that once you share your project on the Scratch website, everyone is free to download, remix, and reuse the project based on the terms of the {licenseLink} license. So if you intend to sell your project, you may want to un-share it from the Scratch website.","faq.sourceCodeTitle":"Where can I find the source code for Scratch?","faq.sourceCodeBody":"The source code for the Scratch programming editor can be found on {guiLink}.

There’s a link at the bottom of every page on Scratch.","faq.reportContentTitle":"What do I do if I see something that’s inappropriate?","faq.reportContentBody":"You can click the link that says \"report\" on any project, comment, discussion post, studio, or profile page where you see something that isn't ok for Scratch. If the situation is complicated, you can use the {contactLink} link (available at the bottom of every page) to explain. Be sure to include as much detail as you can, with links to relevant pages.","faq.noFlameTitle":"What do I do if I see someone being mean or disrespectful?","faq.noFlameBody":"Don’t add to the flames! Responding to mean comments with more mean comments just makes things worse, and could result in your account being blocked. Instead, simply report anything that is disrespectful or unconstructive, and we’ll follow up with the author. We check reports every day, multiple times per day - so rest assured, we'll sort things out.","faq.reviewContentTitle":"What does the Scratch team do when something is reported or flagged?","faq.reviewContentBody":"The Scratch Team reviews reported comments and projects every day. If something breaks the Scratch {cgLink}, we will remove it and send a warning to the account. We may also block the accounts or networks that were used to share it, depending on what was shared and if the person has been sent warnings before","faq.blockedAccountTitle":"What happens when an account is blocked?","faq.blockedAccountBody":"When an account is blocked, the owner can no longer access their account, use it to create projects, or post new comments. When they login, they see a page that explains why the account was blocked, along with a web form they can use to request to be unblocked. If the owner can show that they understand why their account was blocked, and promises to follow the Scratch {cgLink} in the future, they will be unblocked.","faq.stolenAccountTitle":"Someone got access to my account and got my account blocked. What do I do?","faq.stolenAccountBody":"You are responsible for keeping your password secure. If someone you know took control of your account and did bad things, tell the adults in charge of the computer they used. If you think someone you don’t know has access to your account, change the password and / or use the {contactLink} link to explain the situation. If your account was blocked for doing something that you did which broke the Scratch {cgLink}, please don’t tell us that someone else did it. When people tell us someone else used their account to do something bad, we then need to try and talk to that person before we can restore the account. This means your account will just stay blocked for a lot longer than if you are honest with us about what happened.","faq.aboutExtensionsTitle":"What are extensions?","faq.aboutExtensionsBody":"In the Scratch editor, you can add collections of extra blocks called \"extensions.\" For example, there are extensions that enable you to program physical devices (such as micro:bit and LEGO robotics kits) and to translate text within your Scratch projects. We will continue to add new extensions over time, so what you can do with Scratch will continue to grow over time. ","faq.howToAddExtensionsTitle":"How do I add an extension to a project?","faq.howToAddExtensionsBody":"If you click on the \"Extensions\" button in the bottom left corner of the Scratch programming editor, you will see a listing of all Scratch Extensions. When you select one of the extensions, a new category of blocks will be added to your project. The extension will be automatically loaded each time your project is opened. You can add multiple extensions to the same project.","faq.createExtensionsTitle":"How do I create my own extension for Scratch","faq.createExtensionsBody":"The Scratch Team will be publishing specifications and guidelines for extensions in the future. Once available, you will be able to submit extensions to the Scratch Team for consideration in the official Scratch 3.0 extensions library. We’ll also provide guidelines for developing and distributing \"experimental\" extensions, which can be used to create projects on individual computers, but not shared in the Scratch online community.","faq.scratchXTitle":"What will happen to the ScratchX website?","faq.scratchXBody":"The ScratchX website (scratchx.org) was an experimental testbed for extensions. Extensions created for ScratchX are not compatible with Scratch 3.0. Once experimental extensions are fully supported in Scratch we will discontinue support for ScratchX and provide developers and users time to transition off of ScratchX to the new extensions platform.","faq.cloudDataInfoTitle":"What are cloud variables?","faq.cloudDataInfoBody":"Cloud variables allow for data from a project to be saved and shared with other people in the Scratch community.

If people \"see inside\" or remix your code, it creates a copy of the variable and does not affect or change the original variable.","faq.newScratcherCloudTitle":"I am logged in, but I cannot use projects with cloud variables What is going on?","faq.newScratcherCloudBody":"If you are still a \"New Scratcher\" on the website, you will not be able to use projects with cloud variables. You need to become a \"Scratcher\" to have access to cloud variables. See the Accounts section (above) for more information about the transition from “New Scratcher” to \"Scratcher\".","faq.multiplayerTitle":"Is it possible to make multiplayer games with cloud variables?","faq.multiplayerBody":"Multiplayer games may be difficult to create, due to network speed and synchronization issues. However, some Scratchers are coming up with creative ways to use the cloud variables for turn-by-turn and other types of games.","faq.schoolsTitle":"iScratch Ezikoleni","faq.howTitle":"How is Scratch used in schools?","faq.howBody":"Scratch is used in hundreds of thousands of schools around the world, in many different subject areas (including language arts, science, history, math, and computer science).

In that case, all related accounts may be blocked or deleted.","faq.multipleLoginTitle":"Er det OK at flere logger seg inn på en brukerkonto samtidig?","faq.multipleLoginBody":"This is not allowed because the website and project editor can easily get confused when more than one person is logged in to the same account. When an account does something that violates the {cgLink}, all related accounts may be blocked or deleted. If you share an account with someone who does something bad with it, this means your accounts can be blocked for what the other person did.","faq.changeUsernameTitle":"Kan jeg bytte til et annet brukernavn?","faq.changeUsernameBody":"The structure of the Scratch website depends on having a consistent account name, so it’s not possible to change your username. If you really need to switch to a new username, you can make a new account, but you'll have to copy your projects over to the new account on your own.","faq.shareInfoTitle":"Hva slags informasjon kan jeg legge ut på brukerkontoen min?","faq.shareInfoBody":"Please don’t share personal contact information, such as your physical address, email, phone number, or anything else that can be used to make contact outside of the Scratch website. Please report projects, comments, or forum posts that contain this kind of information, so the Scratch Team can remove the information, and remind the author of our policy against sharing personal contact information.","faq.deleteAccountTitle":"Hvordan sletter jeg brukerkontoen min?","faq.deleteAccountBody":"Login to Scratch, and then click your username in the top right-hand corner.

This means your account will just stay blocked for a lot longer than if you are honest with us about what happened.","faq.aboutExtensionsTitle":"What are extensions?","faq.aboutExtensionsBody":"In the Scratch editor, you can add collections of extra blocks called \"extensions.\" For example, there are extensions that enable you to program physical devices (such as micro:bit and LEGO robotics kits) and to translate text within your Scratch projects.

In addition, blocks are slightly bigger in Scratch 3.0 to help address issues we observed with new users having trouble clicking and dragging small interface elements.","faq.extensionsScratch3Title":"Where did the Pen blocks go? Where did the Music blocks go? Where did the Video Sensing blocks go?","faq.extensionsScratch3Body":"The Pen, Music, and Video Sensing blocks have been moved into extensions.

You’ll find tutorials for entire projects (like \"Make a Chase Game\") or specific blocks and features (such as \"Record a Sound\" or \"Make it Spin\"). More tutorials will be added soon (such as \"Pong Game\" and \"Make It Fly\").","faq.remixDefinitionTitle":"Ce este o amestecare?","faq.remixDefinitionBody":"When a Scratcher makes a copy of someone else’s project and modifies it to add their own ideas (for example, by changing scripts or costumes), the resulting project is called a \"remix\". Every project shared to the Scratch website can be remixed. We consider even a minor change to be a valid remix, as long as credit is given to the original project creator and others who made significant contributions to the remix.","faq.remixableTitle":"De ce impune echipa Scratch ca toate proiectele sa poata fi amestecate?","faq.remixableBody":"We believe that remixing other people’s projects is a great way to learn to program and to create interesting projects. Through remixing, creative ideas spread through the Scratch community, and everyone benefits. All projects shared on the Scratch website are covered by the “Creative Commons Share Alike” license, which means that you can remix any project you see on the Scratch website -- and everyone else can remix any of the projects that you share on the website.","faq.creativeCommonsTitle":"Si daca nu doresc ca altii sa imi amestece proiectele?","faq.creativeCommonsBody":"Remixing is an important part of the Scratch community. If you don’t want others to view or remix your creations, you can still create projects on the Scratch website, but don’t share them on the website.","faq.fairUseTitle":"Pot folosi in proiectele mele imagini / sunete / media de pe internet?","faq.fairUseBody":"If you choose to integrate someone else’s work into your own, be sure to give them credit on the project “credits” section, and include a link back to the original. To find art / sounds that are already licensed for remixing, check out the {ccLink}.","faq.ccLinkText":"Creative Commons search page","faq.whyAccountTitle":"Why is it useful to have a Scratch account?","faq.whyAccountBody":"Even without an account, you can play other people’s projects, read comments and forums, and even create your own projects. But you need an account to save and share projects, write comments and forum posts, and participate in other \"social\" activities in the community (like \"loving\" other people’s projects).","faq.createAccountTitle":"How can I create an account?","faq.createAccountBody":"Just click \"Join\" on the Scratch home page. You’ll need to respond to a few questions, and provide an email address. It takes just a couple minutes, and it’s totally free!","faq.checkConfirmedTitle":"Cum pot să verific dacă am contul confirmat?","faq.howToConfirmTitle":"Cum procedez ca sa imi sterg contul?","faq.howToConfirmBody":"After you create a new account on Scratch, you’ll receive an email message with a link. Just click the link to confirm your account. Once you confirm your account, you’ll be able to share projects, write comments, and create studios. Confirming your account also lets you receive email updates from the Scratch Team. If you cannot find the email with the confirmation link, check your Spam folder. If you still can’t find it, and want to receive another copy, go to your Account Settings, click the Email tab, and follow the instructions there. Please note that it may take up to an hour for the email to arrive. If you still don't see the email after an hour, {contactLink}.","faq.contactLinkText":"let us know","faq.checkConfirmedBody":"To check whether your account is confirmed, login to your Scratch account and go to your {settingsLink} page.

After you’ve met the requirements, a link will appear on your profile page inviting you to become a Scratcher, and you’ll have some additional capabilities on the Scratch website. (Note that we don't promote New Scratchers to Scratcher on request )","faq.multipleAccountTitle":"Pot avea mai mult de un cont?","faq.multipleAccountBody":"It's fine to have a few accounts on the Scratch website, as long as none of them are used to break the {cgLink}. In that case, all related accounts may be blocked or deleted.","faq.multipleLoginTitle":"Este voie ca intr-un cont sa se logheze mai mult de o persoana?","faq.multipleLoginBody":"This is not allowed because the website and project editor can easily get confused when more than one person is logged in to the same account. When an account does something that violates the {cgLink}, all related accounts may be blocked or deleted. If you share an account with someone who does something bad with it, this means your accounts can be blocked for what the other person did.","faq.changeUsernameTitle":"Pot sa imi schimb numele de utilizator?","faq.changeUsernameBody":"The structure of the Scratch website depends on having a consistent account name, so it’s not possible to change your username. If you really need to switch to a new username, you can make a new account, but you'll have to copy your projects over to the new account on your own.","faq.shareInfoTitle":"Ce fel de informatii pot sa partajez pe / in legatura cu contul meu?","faq.shareInfoBody":"Please don’t share personal contact information, such as your physical address, email, phone number, or anything else that can be used to make contact outside of the Scratch website. Please report projects, comments, or forum posts that contain this kind of information, so the Scratch Team can remove the information, and remind the author of our policy against sharing personal contact information.","faq.deleteAccountTitle":"Cum procedez ca sa imi sterg contul?","faq.deleteAccountBody":"Login to Scratch, and then click your username in the top right-hand corner.

Raspunzand la meschinarii cu comentarii si mai meschine nu faci decat sa fie mai rau si se poate sfarsi cu blocarea contului tau. In schimb, poti sa raportezi orice este lipsit de respect sau neconstructiv, iar noi il vom urmari pe autor. Verificam raportarile zilnic, de mai multe ori pe zi - asa ca stai linistit, vom regla noi lucrurile.","faq.reviewContentTitle":"Ce face echipa Scratch cand ceva este raportat sau marcat?","faq.reviewContentBody":"The Scratch Team reviews reported comments and projects every day. If something breaks the Scratch {cgLink}, we will remove it and send a warning to the account. We may also block the accounts or networks that were used to share it, depending on what was shared and if the person has been sent warnings before","faq.blockedAccountTitle":"Ce se intampla cand un cont este blocat?","faq.blockedAccountBody":"When an account is blocked, the owner can no longer access their account, use it to create projects, or post new comments. When they login, they see a page that explains why the account was blocked, along with a web form they can use to request to be unblocked. If the owner can show that they understand why their account was blocked, and promises to follow the Scratch {cgLink} in the future, they will be unblocked.","faq.stolenAccountTitle":"Someone got access to my account and got my account blocked. What do I do?","faq.stolenAccountBody":"You are responsible for keeping your password secure. If someone you know took control of your account and did bad things, tell the adults in charge of the computer they used. If you think someone you don’t know has access to your account, change the password and / or use the {contactLink} link to explain the situation. If your account was blocked for doing something that you did which broke the Scratch {cgLink}, please don’t tell us that someone else did it. When people tell us someone else used their account to do something bad, we then need to try and talk to that person before we can restore the account. This means your account will just stay blocked for a lot longer than if you are honest with us about what happened.","faq.aboutExtensionsTitle":"What are extensions?","faq.aboutExtensionsBody":"In the Scratch editor, you can add collections of extra blocks called \"extensions.\" For example, there are extensions that enable you to program physical devices (such as micro:bit and LEGO robotics kits) and to translate text within your Scratch projects. We will continue to add new extensions over time, so what you can do with Scratch will continue to grow over time. ","faq.howToAddExtensionsTitle":"How do I add an extension to a project?","faq.howToAddExtensionsBody":"If you click on the \"Extensions\" button in the bottom left corner of the Scratch programming editor, you will see a listing of all Scratch Extensions.

You can add multiple extensions to the same project.","faq.createExtensionsTitle":"How do I create my own extension for Scratch","faq.createExtensionsBody":"The Scratch Team will be publishing specifications and guidelines for extensions in the future. Once available, you will be able to submit extensions to the Scratch Team for consideration in the official Scratch 3.0 extensions library. We’ll also provide guidelines for developing and distributing \"experimental\" extensions, which can be used to create projects on individual computers, but not shared in the Scratch online community.","faq.scratchXTitle":"What will happen to the ScratchX website?","faq.scratchXBody":"The ScratchX website (scratchx.org) was an experimental testbed for extensions. Extensions created for ScratchX are not compatible with Scratch 3.0.

You need to become a \"Scratcher\" to have access to cloud variables. See the Accounts section (above) for more information about the transition from “New Scratcher” to \"Scratcher\".","faq.multiplayerTitle":"Is it possible to make multiplayer games with cloud variables?","faq.multiplayerBody":"Multiplayer games may be difficult to create, due to network speed and synchronization issues.

If your account was blocked for doing something that you did which broke the Scratch {cgLink}, please don’t tell us that someone else did it.

This means your account will just stay blocked for a lot longer than if you are honest with us about what happened.","faq.aboutExtensionsTitle":"What are extensions?","faq.aboutExtensionsBody":"In the Scratch editor, you can add collections of extra blocks called \"extensions.\" For example, there are extensions that enable you to program physical devices (such as micro:bit and LEGO robotics kits) and to translate text within your Scratch projects.

More tutorials will be added soon (such as \"Pong Game\" and \"Make It Fly\").","faq.remixDefinitionTitle":"Mikä on remiksaus?","faq.remixDefinitionBody":"Kun scratchaaja tekee kopion jonkun toisen projektista ja muuttaa sitä lisäämällä omia ideoita (esimerkiksi muuttamalla skriptejä tai asuja), tuloksena olevaa projektia kutsutaan \"remiksaukseksi\". Jokainen Scratch-sivustolle jaettu projekti voidaan remiksata. Mielestämme myös pieni muutos on pätevä remiksaus, kunhan kunnia annetaan alkuperäiselle projektin luojalle ja muille, jotka ovat osallistuneet merkittävästi remiksaukseen.","faq.remixableTitle":"Miksi Scratch-tiimi vaatii, että kaikki projektit ovat “remiksattavia”?","faq.remixableBody":"Uskomme, että muiden ihmisten projektien muokkaaminen on hyvä tapa oppia ohjelmoimaan ja luomaan mielenkiintoisia projekteja. Remiksaamisen avulla luovat ideat leviävät Scratch-yhteisössä ja kaikki hyötyvät. Kaikki Scratch-sivustossa jaetut projektit kuuluvat “Creative Commons Nimeä-JaaSamoin” -lisenssin piiriin, mikä tarkoittaa, että voit muokata mitä tahansa Scratch-sivustossa näkyvää projektia – ja kaikki muut voivat remiksata minkä tahansa projektin, jonka olet jakanut sivustolla.","faq.creativeCommonsTitle":"Entä jos en halua muiden remiksaavan projektejani?","faq.creativeCommonsBody":"Remiksaaminen on tärkeä osa Scratch-yhteisöä. Jos et halua, että muut näkevät tai muokkaavat luomuksiasi, voit silti luoda projekteja Scratch-verkkosivustolla, mutta älä jaa niitä verkkosivustolla.","faq.fairUseTitle":"Voinko käyttää internetistä peräisin olevia kuvia / ääniä / mediaa projekteissani?","faq.fairUseBody":"If you choose to integrate someone else’s work into your own, be sure to give them credit on the project “credits” section, and include a link back to the original. To find art / sounds that are already licensed for remixing, check out the {ccLink}.","faq.ccLinkText":"Creative Commons search page","faq.whyAccountTitle":"Miksi on hyödyllistä omistaa Scratch-tili?","faq.whyAccountBody":"Even without an account, you can play other people’s projects, read comments and forums, and even create your own projects.

Just click the link to confirm your account. Once you confirm your account, you’ll be able to share projects, write comments, and create studios. Confirming your account also lets you receive email updates from the Scratch Team. If you cannot find the email with the confirmation link, check your Spam folder.

After you’ve met the requirements, a link will appear on your profile page inviting you to become a Scratcher, and you’ll have some additional capabilities on the Scratch website. (Note that we don't promote New Scratchers to Scratcher on request )","faq.multipleAccountTitle":"Voiko minulla olla useampi kuin yksi tili?","faq.multipleAccountBody":"It's fine to have a few accounts on the Scratch website, as long as none of them are used to break the {cgLink}. In that case, all related accounts may be blocked or deleted.","faq.multipleLoginTitle":"Onko OK, jos useampi kuin yksi henkilö on kirjautuneena tiliin?","faq.multipleLoginBody":"This is not allowed because the website and project editor can easily get confused when more than one person is logged in to the same account. When an account does something that violates the {cgLink}, all related accounts may be blocked or deleted. If you share an account with someone who does something bad with it, this means your accounts can be blocked for what the other person did.","faq.changeUsernameTitle":"Voinko vaihtaa käyttäjätunnukseni?","faq.changeUsernameBody":"The structure of the Scratch website depends on having a consistent account name, so it’s not possible to change your username. If you really need to switch to a new username, you can make a new account, but you'll have to copy your projects over to the new account on your own.","faq.shareInfoTitle":"Mitä tietoja voin jakaa tilini kanssa?","faq.shareInfoBody":"Please don’t share personal contact information, such as your physical address, email, phone number, or anything else that can be used to make contact outside of the Scratch website. Please report projects, comments, or forum posts that contain this kind of information, so the Scratch Team can remove the information, and remind the author of our policy against sharing personal contact information.","faq.deleteAccountTitle":"Miten poistan tilini?","faq.deleteAccountBody":"Login to Scratch, and then click your username in the top right-hand corner. Select \"Account Settings\", then click the \"I want to delete my account\" link at the bottom of the page. But you should only do this if you are absolutely sure that you want to delete your account.","faq.scratchFreeTitle":"Onko Scratch ilmainen? Voinko käyttää sitä missä tahansa?","faq.scratchFreeBody":"Yes! Scratch is available free of charge.

Be sure to include as much detail as you can, with links to relevant pages.","faq.noFlameTitle":"Mitä teen, jos näen jonkun olevan ilkeä tai epäkunnioittava?","faq.noFlameBody":"Don’t add to the flames! Responding to mean comments with more mean comments just makes things worse, and could result in your account being blocked. Instead, simply report anything that is disrespectful or unconstructive, and we’ll follow up with the author. We check reports every day, multiple times per day - so rest assured, we'll sort things out.","faq.reviewContentTitle":"Mitä Scratch-tiimi tekee, kun jotain ilmoitetaan tai merkitään?","faq.reviewContentBody":"The Scratch Team reviews reported comments and projects every day. If something breaks the Scratch {cgLink}, we will remove it and send a warning to the account. We may also block the accounts or networks that were used to share it, depending on what was shared and if the person has been sent warnings before","faq.blockedAccountTitle":"Mitä tapahtuu, kun tili on estetty?","faq.blockedAccountBody":"When an account is blocked, the owner can no longer access their account, use it to create projects, or post new comments. When they login, they see a page that explains why the account was blocked, along with a web form they can use to request to be unblocked. If the owner can show that they understand why their account was blocked, and promises to follow the Scratch {cgLink} in the future, they will be unblocked.","faq.stolenAccountTitle":"Joku pääsi tililleni ja tilini on estetty. Mitä teen?","faq.stolenAccountBody":"You are responsible for keeping your password secure. If someone you know took control of your account and did bad things, tell the adults in charge of the computer they used. If you think someone you don’t know has access to your account, change the password and / or use the {contactLink} link to explain the situation. If your account was blocked for doing something that you did which broke the Scratch {cgLink}, please don’t tell us that someone else did it. When people tell us someone else used their account to do something bad, we then need to try and talk to that person before we can restore the account. This means your account will just stay blocked for a lot longer than if you are honest with us about what happened.","faq.aboutExtensionsTitle":"Mitä ovat laajennukset?","faq.aboutExtensionsBody":"In the Scratch editor, you can add collections of extra blocks called \"extensions.\" For example, there are extensions that enable you to program physical devices (such as micro:bit and LEGO robotics kits) and to translate text within your Scratch projects. We will continue to add new extensions over time, so what you can do with Scratch will continue to grow over time. ","faq.howToAddExtensionsTitle":"Miten voin lisätä projektiin laajennuksen?","faq.howToAddExtensionsBody":"If you click on the \"Extensions\" button in the bottom left corner of the Scratch programming editor, you will see a listing of all Scratch Extensions.

You can add multiple extensions to the same project.","faq.createExtensionsTitle":"Miten luot oman laajennuksen Scratchiin?","faq.createExtensionsBody":"The Scratch Team will be publishing specifications and guidelines for extensions in the future. Once available, you will be able to submit extensions to the Scratch Team for consideration in the official Scratch 3.0 extensions library. We’ll also provide guidelines for developing and distributing \"experimental\" extensions, which can be used to create projects on individual computers, but not shared in the Scratch online community.","faq.scratchXTitle":"Mitä tapahtuu ScratchX-sivustolle?","faq.scratchXBody":"The ScratchX website (scratchx.org) was an experimental testbed for extensions. Extensions created for ScratchX are not compatible with Scratch 3.0.

Mitä tapahtuu?","faq.newScratcherCloudBody":"If you are still a \"New Scratcher\" on the website, you will not be able to use projects with cloud variables.

But you need an account to save and share projects, write comments and forum posts, and participate in other \"social\" activities in the community (like \"loving\" other people’s projects).","faq.createAccountTitle":"How can I create an account?","faq.createAccountBody":"Just click \"Join\" on the Scratch home page. You’ll need to respond to a few questions, and provide an email address. It takes just a couple minutes, and it’s totally free!","faq.checkConfirmedTitle":"Hur kan jag kolla om mitt konto har bekräftats?","faq.howToConfirmTitle":"Hur bekräftar jag mitt konto?","faq.howToConfirmBody":"After you create a new account on Scratch, you’ll receive an email message with a link. Just click the link to confirm your account. Once you confirm your account, you’ll be able to share projects, write comments, and create studios. Confirming your account also lets you receive email updates from the Scratch Team. If you cannot find the email with the confirmation link, check your Spam folder. If you still can’t find it, and want to receive another copy, go to your Account Settings, click the Email tab, and follow the instructions there. Please note that it may take up to an hour for the email to arrive. If you still don't see the email after an hour, {contactLink}.","faq.contactLinkText":"let us know","faq.checkConfirmedBody":"To check whether your account is confirmed, login to your Scratch account and go to your {settingsLink} page. Confirmed email addresses will show a small green checkmark. Otherwise, you will see the text \"Your email address is unconfirmed\" in orange.","faq.settingsLinkText":"Email Settings","faq.requireConfirmTitle":"Behöver jag bekräfta mitt konto?","faq.requireConfirmBody":"You can still use many aspects of Scratch without confirming your account, including creating and saving projects (without sharing them).","faq.forgotPasswordTitle":"I forgot my username or password. How can I reset it?","faq.forgotPasswordBody":"Enter your username or email address on the {resetLink} page. The website will send an email to the address associated with your username and a link you can use to reset your password.","faq.resetLinkText":"Password Reset","faq.changePasswordTitle":"Hur ändrar jag mitt lösenord?","faq.changePasswordBody":"Login to your Scratch account, then visit our {changeLink} page where you can change your password.","faq.changeLinkText":"Password Settings","faq.changeEmailTitle":"Hur ändrar jag min e-postadress?","faq.changeEmailBody":"Login to your Scratch account, then visit our {changeEmailLink} page where you can change your email address.","faq.newScratcherTitle":"Hur går jag över från 'Ny scratchare' till 'Scratchare'? ","faq.newScratcherBody":"When you create an account, you’ll be labelled as a “New Scratcher.” To make the transition to \"Scratcher\", you should make and share projects, comment helpfully on other Scratchers’ projects, and be patient! After you’ve met the requirements, a link will appear on your profile page inviting you to become a Scratcher, and you’ll have some additional capabilities on the Scratch website. (Note that we don't promote New Scratchers to Scratcher on request )","faq.multipleAccountTitle":"Kan jag ha mer än ett konto?","faq.multipleAccountBody":"It's fine to have a few accounts on the Scratch website, as long as none of them are used to break the {cgLink}. In that case, all related accounts may be blocked or deleted.","faq.multipleLoginTitle":"Är det ok att ha mer än en person inloggad på ett konto?","faq.multipleLoginBody":"This is not allowed because the website and project editor can easily get confused when more than one person is logged in to the same account. When an account does something that violates the {cgLink}, all related accounts may be blocked or deleted. If you share an account with someone who does something bad with it, this means your accounts can be blocked for what the other person did.","faq.changeUsernameTitle":"Kan jag ändra mitt användarnamn?","faq.changeUsernameBody":"The structure of the Scratch website depends on having a consistent account name, so it’s not possible to change your username. If you really need to switch to a new username, you can make a new account, but you'll have to copy your projects over to the new account on your own.","faq.shareInfoTitle":"Vilken information kan jag dela på/med mitt konto?","faq.shareInfoBody":"Please don’t share personal contact information, such as your physical address, email, phone number, or anything else that can be used to make contact outside of the Scratch website. Please report projects, comments, or forum posts that contain this kind of information, so the Scratch Team can remove the information, and remind the author of our policy against sharing personal contact information.","faq.deleteAccountTitle":"Hur raderar jag mitt konto?","faq.deleteAccountBody":"Login to Scratch, and then click your username in the top right-hand corner. Select \"Account Settings\", then click the \"I want to delete my account\" link at the bottom of the page.

But keep in mind that once you share your project on the Scratch website, everyone is free to download, remix, and reuse the project based on the terms of the {licenseLink} license. So if you intend to sell your project, you may want to un-share it from the Scratch website.","faq.sourceCodeTitle":"Var kan jag hitta källkoden för Scratch?","faq.sourceCodeBody":"The source code for the Scratch programming editor can be found on {guiLink}.

There’s a link at the bottom of every page on Scratch.","faq.reportContentTitle":"Vad gör jag om jag ser något som är olämpligt?","faq.reportContentBody":"You can click the link that says \"report\" on any project, comment, discussion post, studio, or profile page where you see something that isn't ok for Scratch. If the situation is complicated, you can use the {contactLink} link (available at the bottom of every page) to explain. Be sure to include as much detail as you can, with links to relevant pages.","faq.noFlameTitle":"Vad gör jag om jag ser att någon är elak eller respektlös?","faq.noFlameBody":"Lägg inte till fler elaka kommentarer! Att svara med fler elaka kommentarer gör det oftast värre och kan resultera i att ditt konto blockeras. Rapportera istället det som är respektlöst eller icke-konstruktivt, och vi kommer att följa upp det med den som skrivit det. Vi kontrollerar rapporter varje dag, flera gånger per dag - så känn dig säker, vi kommer att reda ut situationen.","faq.reviewContentTitle":"Vad gör Scratchteamet när något rapporterats eller flaggats?","faq.reviewContentBody":"The Scratch Team reviews reported comments and projects every day. If something breaks the Scratch {cgLink}, we will remove it and send a warning to the account. We may also block the accounts or networks that were used to share it, depending on what was shared and if the person has been sent warnings before","faq.blockedAccountTitle":"Vad händer när ett konto blockeras?","faq.blockedAccountBody":"When an account is blocked, the owner can no longer access their account, use it to create projects, or post new comments. When they login, they see a page that explains why the account was blocked, along with a web form they can use to request to be unblocked. If the owner can show that they understand why their account was blocked, and promises to follow the Scratch {cgLink} in the future, they will be unblocked.","faq.stolenAccountTitle":"Someone got access to my account and got my account blocked. What do I do?","faq.stolenAccountBody":"You are responsible for keeping your password secure. If someone you know took control of your account and did bad things, tell the adults in charge of the computer they used. If you think someone you don’t know has access to your account, change the password and / or use the {contactLink} link to explain the situation. If your account was blocked for doing something that you did which broke the Scratch {cgLink}, please don’t tell us that someone else did it. When people tell us someone else used their account to do something bad, we then need to try and talk to that person before we can restore the account. This means your account will just stay blocked for a lot longer than if you are honest with us about what happened.","faq.aboutExtensionsTitle":"What are extensions?","faq.aboutExtensionsBody":"In the Scratch editor, you can add collections of extra blocks called \"extensions.\" For example, there are extensions that enable you to program physical devices (such as micro:bit and LEGO robotics kits) and to translate text within your Scratch projects. We will continue to add new extensions over time, so what you can do with Scratch will continue to grow over time. ","faq.howToAddExtensionsTitle":"How do I add an extension to a project?","faq.howToAddExtensionsBody":"If you click on the \"Extensions\" button in the bottom left corner of the Scratch programming editor, you will see a listing of all Scratch Extensions. When you select one of the extensions, a new category of blocks will be added to your project. The extension will be automatically loaded each time your project is opened. You can add multiple extensions to the same project.","faq.createExtensionsTitle":"How do I create my own extension for Scratch","faq.createExtensionsBody":"The Scratch Team will be publishing specifications and guidelines for extensions in the future. Once available, you will be able to submit extensions to the Scratch Team for consideration in the official Scratch 3.0 extensions library. We’ll also provide guidelines for developing and distributing \"experimental\" extensions, which can be used to create projects on individual computers, but not shared in the Scratch online community.","faq.scratchXTitle":"What will happen to the ScratchX website?","faq.scratchXBody":"The ScratchX website (scratchx.org) was an experimental testbed for extensions. Extensions created for ScratchX are not compatible with Scratch 3.0. Once experimental extensions are fully supported in Scratch we will discontinue support for ScratchX and provide developers and users time to transition off of ScratchX to the new extensions platform.","faq.cloudDataInfoTitle":"What are cloud variables?","faq.cloudDataInfoBody":"Cloud variables allow for data from a project to be saved and shared with other people in the Scratch community.

If people \"see inside\" or remix your code, it creates a copy of the variable and does not affect or change the original variable.","faq.newScratcherCloudTitle":"I am logged in, but I cannot use projects with cloud variables What is going on?","faq.newScratcherCloudBody":"If you are still a \"New Scratcher\" on the website, you will not be able to use projects with cloud variables. You need to become a \"Scratcher\" to have access to cloud variables. See the Accounts section (above) for more information about the transition from “New Scratcher” to \"Scratcher\".","faq.multiplayerTitle":"Is it possible to make multiplayer games with cloud variables?","faq.multiplayerBody":"Multiplayer games may be difficult to create, due to network speed and synchronization issues. However, some Scratchers are coming up with creative ways to use the cloud variables for turn-by-turn and other types of games.","faq.schoolsTitle":"Scratch i skolan","faq.howTitle":"Hur används Scratch i skolorna?","faq.howBody":"Scratch is used in hundreds of thousands of schools around the world, in many different subject areas (including language arts, science, history, math, and computer science).

In that case, all related accounts may be blocked or deleted.","faq.multipleLoginTitle":"Иманшәалома ԥыҭҩык аккаунтк ала иҭалозар?","faq.multipleLoginBody":"This is not allowed because the website and project editor can easily get confused when more than one person is logged in to the same account. When an account does something that violates the {cgLink}, all related accounts may be blocked or deleted. If you share an account with someone who does something bad with it, this means your accounts can be blocked for what the other person did.","faq.changeUsernameTitle":"Исылшоума сара алахәлаҩ ҳасаблатәи сыхьӡ аԥсахра?","faq.changeUsernameBody":"The structure of the Scratch website depends on having a consistent account name, so it’s not possible to change your username.

If your account was blocked for doing something that you did which broke the Scratch {cgLink}, please don’t tell us that someone else did it. When people tell us someone else used their account to do something bad, we then need to try and talk to that person before we can restore the account. This means your account will just stay blocked for a lot longer than if you are honest with us about what happened.","faq.aboutExtensionsTitle":"What are extensions?","faq.aboutExtensionsBody":"In the Scratch editor, you can add collections of extra blocks called \"extensions.\" For example, there are extensions that enable you to program physical devices (such as micro:bit and LEGO robotics kits) and to translate text within your Scratch projects.

","faq.howToAddExtensionsTitle":"How do I add an extension to a project?","faq.howToAddExtensionsBody":"If you click on the \"Extensions\" button in the bottom left corner of the Scratch programming editor, you will see a listing of all Scratch Extensions.

When they login, they see a page that explains why the account was blocked, along with a web form they can use to request to be unblocked. If the owner can show that they understand why their account was blocked, and promises to follow the Scratch {cgLink} in the future, they will be unblocked.","faq.stolenAccountTitle":"Someone got access to my account and got my account blocked. What do I do?","faq.stolenAccountBody":"You are responsible for keeping your password secure. If someone you know took control of your account and did bad things, tell the adults in charge of the computer they used. If you think someone you don’t know has access to your account, change the password and / or use the {contactLink} link to explain the situation. If your account was blocked for doing something that you did which broke the Scratch {cgLink}, please don’t tell us that someone else did it. When people tell us someone else used their account to do something bad, we then need to try and talk to that person before we can restore the account. This means your account will just stay blocked for a lot longer than if you are honest with us about what happened.","faq.aboutExtensionsTitle":"What are extensions?","faq.aboutExtensionsBody":"In the Scratch editor, you can add collections of extra blocks called \"extensions.\" For example, there are extensions that enable you to program physical devices (such as micro:bit and LEGO robotics kits) and to translate text within your Scratch projects.

Once available, you will be able to submit extensions to the Scratch Team for consideration in the official Scratch 3.0 extensions library. We’ll also provide guidelines for developing and distributing \"experimental\" extensions, which can be used to create projects on individual computers, but not shared in the Scratch online community.","faq.scratchXTitle":"What will happen to the ScratchX website?","faq.scratchXBody":"The ScratchX website (scratchx.org) was an experimental testbed for extensions.

When they login, they see a page that explains why the account was blocked, along with a web form they can use to request to be unblocked.

If your account was blocked for doing something that you did which broke the Scratch {cgLink}, please don’t tell us that someone else did it. When people tell us someone else used their account to do something bad, we then need to try and talk to that person before we can restore the account. This means your account will just stay blocked for a lot longer than if you are honest with us about what happened.","faq.aboutExtensionsTitle":"¿Qué son las extensiones?","faq.aboutExtensionsBody":"En el editor Scratch puedes añadir bloques extra llamados \"extensiones\". Por ejemplo, hay extensiones que permiten programar dispositivos físicos (como micro:bit y kits de robótica de LEGO) y otras para traducir texto dentro de tu proyecto Scratch.

In ionad sin, déan tuairisc ar aon rud dímheasúil nó míchabhrach, agus rachaimid i dteagmháil leis an údar.

If your account was blocked for doing something that you did which broke the Scratch {cgLink}, please don’t tell us that someone else did it. When people tell us someone else used their account to do something bad, we then need to try and talk to that person before we can restore the account. This means your account will just stay blocked for a lot longer than if you are honest with us about what happened.","faq.aboutExtensionsTitle":"What are extensions?","faq.aboutExtensionsBody":"In the Scratch editor, you can add collections of extra blocks called \"extensions.\" For example, there are extensions that enable you to program physical devices (such as micro:bit and LEGO robotics kits) and to translate text within your Scratch projects.

In that case, all related accounts may be blocked or deleted.","faq.multipleLoginTitle":"Is het oké als er meer dan één persoon ingelogd is met dezelfde gebruikersnaam?","faq.multipleLoginBody":"This is not allowed because the website and project editor can easily get confused when more than one person is logged in to the same account. When an account does something that violates the {cgLink}, all related accounts may be blocked or deleted. If you share an account with someone who does something bad with it, this means your accounts can be blocked for what the other person did.","faq.changeUsernameTitle":"Kan ik mijn gebruikersnaam wijzigen?","faq.changeUsernameBody":"De structuur van de Scratch website is afhankelijk van het hebben van een consistente accountnaam, dus het is niet mogelijk om je gebruikersnaam te wijzigen. Als je echt moet overschakelen naar een nieuwe gebruikersnaam, kun je een nieuwe account aanmaken, maar je moet je projecten zelf kopiëren naar het nieuwe account.","faq.shareInfoTitle":"Welke informatie kan ik delen op / met mijn account?","faq.shareInfoBody":"Deel geen persoonlijke contactgegevens, zoals je fysieke adres, e-mail, telefoonnummer of iets anders dat gebruikt kan worden om contact op te nemen buiten de Scratch-website om. Meld projecten, opmerkingen of forumberichten die dit soort informatie bevatten, zodat het Scratch Team de informatie kan verwijderen en de auteur kan herinneren aan ons beleid tegen het delen van persoonlijke contactgegevens.","faq.deleteAccountTitle":"Hoe kan ik mijn account verwijderen?","faq.deleteAccountBody":"Login to Scratch, and then click your username in the top right-hand corner. Select \"Account Settings\", then click the \"I want to delete my account\" link at the bottom of the page. But you should only do this if you are absolutely sure that you want to delete your account.","faq.scratchFreeTitle":"Is Scratch gratis? Kan ik het gebruiken waar ik maar wil?","faq.scratchFreeBody":"Ja! Scratch is helemaal gratis. Je kunt het op je school gebruiken en je mag er ook cursussen in geven (zelfs als deze cursus geld kost). Je hoeft geen licentie te kopen - het is gratis.","faq.scratchScreenshotTitle":"Kan ik schermafdrukken van Scratch gebruiken in een boek of presentatie?","faq.scratchScreenshotBody":"Yes, you can use screenshots / images of the Scratch application and website in a book or presentation, and consider them to be licensed under the {licenseLink} license. We ask that you include a note somewhere in your materials  saying: \"Scratch is a project of the Scratch Foundation, in collaboration with the Lifelong Kindergarten Group at the MIT Media Lab. It is available for free at https://scratch.mit.edu\".","faq.licenseLinkText":"Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike","faq.scratchDescriptionTitle":"Kan ik een beschrijving van Scratch opnemen in folders en andere materialen?","faq.scratchDescriptionBody":"Sure! We recommend the following description: \"Scratch is a coding  language and online community where you can create your own interactive stories, games, and animations -- and share your creations with others around the world. As young people create and share Scratch projects, they learn to think creatively, reason systematically, and work collaboratively. Scratch is a project of the {sfLink} in collaboration with the Lifelong Kindergarten group at the MIT Media Lab. It is available for free at https://scratch.mit.edu\"","faq.presentScratchTitle":"Mag ik een presentatie over Scratch houden tijdens een bijeenkomst?","faq.presentScratchBody":"Voel je vrij om presentaties te geven over Scratch aan leerkrachten of andere groepen.","faq.supportMaterialTitle":"Mag ik Scratchmaterialen, sprites, afbeeldingen, geluiden of voorbeeldprojecten van deze website (her)gebruiken?","faq.supportMaterialBody":"Yes: Most Scratch support materials on the Scratch website are available under the {licenseLink} license. There are a few exceptions: the Scratch Logo, Scratch Cat, Gobo, Pico, Nano, Giga, and Tera are Scratch trademarks, and can not be used without explicit permission from the Scratch Team.","faq.sellProjectsTitle":"Mag ik mijn Scratch-projecten verkopen?","faq.sellProjectsBody":"Yes: Your Scratch project is your creation. But keep in mind that once you share your project on the Scratch website, everyone is free to download, remix, and reuse the project based on the terms of the {licenseLink} license. So if you intend to sell your project, you may want to un-share it from the Scratch website.","faq.sourceCodeTitle":"Waar kan ik de broncode vinden van Scratch?","faq.sourceCodeBody":"The source code for the Scratch programming editor can be found on {guiLink}. The source code for {flashLink} and {scratch14Link}, are also available on GitHub. For updated information on development projects relating to the Scratch website, please visit our {developersLink}.","faq.scratch14":"Scratch 1.4","faq.okayToShareTitle":"Hoe weet ik wat wel en niet oké is om te delen op de Scratch-website?","faq.okayToShareBody":"Check out the Scratch {cgLink} - they’re brief and don’t include a lot of legal stuff. There’s a link at the bottom of every page on Scratch.","faq.reportContentTitle":"Wat moet ik doen als ik iets onbehoorlijks zie?","faq.reportContentBody":"You can click the link that says \"report\" on any project, comment, discussion post, studio, or profile page where you see something that isn't ok for Scratch. If the situation is complicated, you can use the {contactLink} link (available at the bottom of every page) to explain. Be sure to include as much detail as you can, with links to relevant pages.","faq.noFlameTitle":"Wat moet ik doen als ik zie dat iemand gemeen of respectloos is?","faq.noFlameBody":"Gooi geen olie op het vuur! Door op gemene reacties te reageren met meer gemene reacties, maak je het alleen maar erger en dat kan er voor zorgen dat jóuw account geblokkeerd wordt. In plaats daarvan kun je het beste alles, wat respectloos of niet constructief is, melden en dan nemen wij contact op met de schrijver. We controleren de meldingen elke dag, meerdere keren per dag - wees er dus gerust op dat wij het voor je regelen.","faq.reviewContentTitle":"Wat doet het Scratch-team als er iets gemeld of gerapporteerd wordt?","faq.reviewContentBody":"The Scratch Team reviews reported comments and projects every day. If something breaks the Scratch {cgLink}, we will remove it and send a warning to the account. We may also block the accounts or networks that were used to share it, depending on what was shared and if the person has been sent warnings before","faq.blockedAccountTitle":"Wat gebeurd er met een gebruikersnaam dat geblokkeerd is?","faq.blockedAccountBody":"When an account is blocked, the owner can no longer access their account, use it to create projects, or post new comments. When they login, they see a page that explains why the account was blocked, along with a web form they can use to request to be unblocked. If the owner can show that they understand why their account was blocked, and promises to follow the Scratch {cgLink} in the future, they will be unblocked.","faq.stolenAccountTitle":"Iemand kreeg toegang tot mijn account en nu is mijn account geblokkeerd. Wat moet ik doen?","faq.stolenAccountBody":"You are responsible for keeping your password secure. If someone you know took control of your account and did bad things, tell the adults in charge of the computer they used. If you think someone you don’t know has access to your account, change the password and / or use the {contactLink} link to explain the situation. If your account was blocked for doing something that you did which broke the Scratch {cgLink}, please don’t tell us that someone else did it. When people tell us someone else used their account to do something bad, we then need to try and talk to that person before we can restore the account. This means your account will just stay blocked for a lot longer than if you are honest with us about what happened.","faq.aboutExtensionsTitle":"Wat zijn uitbreidingen?","faq.aboutExtensionsBody":"In de Scratch-editor kun je verzamelingen van extra blokken toevoegen die \" uitbreidingen\" worden genoemd. Er zijn bijvoorbeeld uitbreidingen waarmee je fysieke apparaten kunt programmeren (zoals micro:bit en LEGO robotica sets) en tekst kunt vertalen binnen je Scratch projecten. We zullen na verloop van tijd nieuwe uitbreidingen blijven toevoegen, zodat wat je met Scratch kunt doen in de loop van de tijd zal blijven groeien. ","faq.howToAddExtensionsTitle":"Hoe voeg ik een uitbreiding toe aan een project? ","faq.howToAddExtensionsBody":"If you click on the \"Extensions\" button in the bottom left corner of the Scratch programming editor, you will see a listing of all Scratch Extensions. When you select one of the extensions, a new category of blocks will be added to your project. The extension will be automatically loaded each time your project is opened. You can add multiple extensions to the same project.","faq.createExtensionsTitle":"Hoe maak ik mijn eigen uitbreiding voor Scratch","faq.createExtensionsBody":"Het Scratch Team zal in de toekomst specificaties en richtlijnen voor uitbreidingen publiceren. Eenmaal beschikbaar, kun je uitbreidingen indienen bij het Scratch team voor bestudering in de officiële Scratch 3.0 uitbreidingen bibliotheek. We bieden ook richtlijnen voor het ontwikkelen en distribueren van \"experimentele\" uitbreidingen, die gebruikt kunnen worden om projecten te maken op individuele computers, maar niet gedeeld worden in de Scratch online community.","faq.scratchXTitle":"Wat gebeurt er met de ScratchX website?","faq.scratchXBody":"De ScratchX website (scratchx.org) was een experimentele testomgeving voor uitbreidingen. Uitbreidingen die voor ScratchX zijn gemaakt, zijn niet te combineren met Scratch 3.0. Zodra experimentele uitbreidingen volledig worden ondersteund in Scratch zullen we de ondersteuning voor ScratchX stopzetten en ontwikkelaars en gebruikers tijd geven om over te stappen van ScratchX naar het nieuwe uitbreidingen platform.","faq.cloudDataInfoTitle":"Wat zijn cloud variabelen?","faq.cloudDataInfoBody":"Cloud variabelen maken het mogelijk om gegevens van een project op te slaan en te delen met andere mensen in de Scratch-community. Met behulp van cloud variabelen kun je vragenlijsten en andere projecten maken waar anderen in de community de gegevens in de loop der tijd kunnen raadplegen en wijzigen.","faq.makeCloudVarTitle":"Hoe kan ik een cloud variabele maken?","faq.makeCloudVarBody":"Go to the \"Variables\" section of the blocks palette, select \"Make a Variable\", and then click the checkbox next to \"Cloud variable (stored on server)\". The data associated with your cloud variable will be stored on the server, preserved over time, and accessible to anyone who opens the project.","faq.onlyNumbersTitle":"Welke soorten gegevens kunnen worden opgeslagen in cloud variabelen?","faq.onlyNumbersBody":"Alleen getallen kunnen worden opgeslagen in cloud variabelen.","faq.storedCloudInfoTitle":"Wie kan de gegevens zien die zijn opgeslagen in de cloud variabelen?","faq.storedCloudInfoBody":"Wanneer je werkt met een project dat cloud variabelen gebruikt, kunnen de gegevens over je interacties samen met je gebruikersnaam worden opgeslagen en kunnen anderen deze bekijken.","faq.reportCloudTitle":"Als ik iemand ongepaste inhoud zie plaatsen met behulp van cloud variabelen, hoe meld ik dit dan?","faq.reportCloudBody":"Click the \"Report this\" button (under on the project player on the project page) to report inappropriate content in cloud variables. Make sure that you mention \"cloud variables\" when you type your reason in the report.","faq.chatRoomTitle":"Kan ik chatrooms maken met cloud variabelen?","faq.chatRoomBody":"Hoewel het technisch mogelijk is om chatrooms te maken met cloud variabelen, zijn deze niet toegestaan op de Scratch website.","faq.changeCloudVarTitle":"Wie kan de informatie in een cloudvariabele veranderen?","faq.changeCloudVarBody":"Only you and viewers of your project can store data in your project’s cloud variables. If people \"see inside\" or remix your code, it creates a copy of the variable and does not affect or change the original variable.","faq.newScratcherCloudTitle":"Ik ben ingelogd, maar ik kan nog geen projecten gebruiken met cloud variabelen. Hoe kan dit?","faq.newScratcherCloudBody":"Als je nog steeds een \"Nieuwe Scratcher\" bent op de website, zul je geen projecten met cloud variabelen kunnen gebruiken. Je moet een \"Scratcher\" worden om toegang te hebben tot cloud variabelen. Zie het gedeelte Accounts (hierboven) voor meer informatie over de overgang van \"Nieuwe Scratcher\" naar \"Scratcher\".","faq.multiplayerTitle":"Is het mogelijk om multiplayer games te maken met cloud variabelen?","faq.multiplayerBody":"Multiplayer games kunnen moeilijk te maken zijn, vanwege netwerksnelheid en synchronisatieproblemen. Desondanks bedenken sommige Scratchers creatieve manieren om de cloud variabelen te gebruiken voor om-de-beurt en andere soorten spelletjes.","faq.schoolsTitle":"Scratch in Scholen","faq.howTitle":"Hoe wordt Scratch in scholen gebruikt?","faq.howBody":"Scratch is used in hundreds of thousands of schools around the world, in many different subject areas (including language arts, science, history, math, and computer science). You can learn more about strategies and resources for using Scratch in schools and other learning environments (such as museums, libraries, and community centers) on our {educatorsLink}.","faq.educatorsLinkText":"Educators Page","faq.noInternetTitle":"Is er een manier voor studenten om Scratch te gebruiken zonder internet verbinding?","faq.noInternetBody":"Yes. {downloadLink} is a version of Scratch that runs on a desktop or laptop computer. Currently, Scratch Desktop is available for Mac and Windows machines.","faq.communityTitle":"Kan ik de online community uitschakelen voor mijn studenten?","faq.communityBody":"The Scratch online community provides a way for young people to share, collaborate, and learn with their peers within a moderated community governed by the Scratch {cgLink}. However, we understand that some educators prefer that their students not participate in an online community. These educators may wish to install Scratch Desktop, which runs offline and locally on a desktop or laptop computer.","faq.teacherAccountTitle":"Wat is een Scratch leerkracht account?","faq.teacherAccountBody":"A Scratch Teacher Account provides teachers and other educators with additional features to manage student participation on Scratch, including the ability to create student accounts, organize student projects into studios, and monitor student comments. For more information on Scratch Teacher Accounts, see the {eduFaqLink}.","faq.eduFaqLinkText":"Scratch-leerkrachtaccount FAQ","faq.requestTitle":"Hoe vraag ik een Scratch leerkracht account aan?","faq.requestBody":"You may request a Scratch Teacher Account from the {educatorsLink} on Scratch. We ask for additional information during the registration process in order to verify your role as an educator.","faq.dataTitle":"Welke leerlinggegevens worden door Scratch verzameld?","faq.dataBody":"Bij de aanmelding bij Scratch, vragen we enkele persoonlijke gegevens zoals geslacht, leeftijd (geboortejaar en -maand), land en een e-mailadres ter verificatie. Deze gegevens worden (in geaggregeerde vorm) gebruikt voor onderzoek gericht op een beter inzicht in de manier waarop mensen met Scratch leren. Als een leerkracht via een Scratch leerkracht account in bulk leerling accounts aanmaakt dan hoeven de leerlingen geen e-mailadres door te geven.  ","faq.lawComplianceTitle":"Voldoet Scratch (online versie) aan de lokale en federale privacywetgeving in de Verenigde Staten?","faq.lawComplianceBody1":"Scratch cares deeply about the privacy of students and of all individuals who use our platform.

More tutorials will be added soon (such as \"Pong Game\" and \"Make It Fly\").","faq.remixDefinitionTitle":"O que é uma remistura?","faq.remixDefinitionBody":"Quando um Scratchador faz uma cópia do projecto de alguém e o modifica para lhe adicionar as suas próprias ideias (por exemplo, alterando guiões ou trajes), o projecto resultante diz-se uma «remistura». Todos os projectos partilhados no Scratch podem ser remisturados. Mesmo a mais pequena das alterações é considerada uma remistura válida, desde que seja dado devido crédito ao criador original do projecto e a outros que tenham contribuído de forma significativa para a remistura.","faq.remixableTitle":"Por que é que a Equipa Scratch requer que todos os projectos sejam «remisturáveis»?","faq.remixableBody":"Cremos que remisturar os projectos de outras pessoas é uma excelente forma de aprender a programar e de criar projectos interessantes. Através da remistura, as ideias criativas são disseminadas pela comunidade do Scratch e todos beneficiam. Todos os projectos partilhados no sítio web do Scratch ficam ao abrigo da licença «Creative Commons Atribuição-CompartilhaIgual», o que significa que pode remisturar qualquer projecto que veja no sítio web do Scratch – e que todas as outras pessoas poderão remisturar qualquer dos projectos que partilhar no sítio web.","faq.creativeCommonsTitle":"E se eu não quiser que outras pessoas remisturem os meus projectos?","faq.creativeCommonsBody":"A remistura é uma parte importante da comunidade do Scratch.

It takes just a couple minutes, and it’s totally free!","faq.checkConfirmedTitle":"Como posso verificar se a minha conta foi confirmada?","faq.howToConfirmTitle":"Como confirmo a minha conta?","faq.howToConfirmBody":"After you create a new account on Scratch, you’ll receive an email message with a link. Just click the link to confirm your account. Once you confirm your account, you’ll be able to share projects, write comments, and create studios. Confirming your account also lets you receive email updates from the Scratch Team. If you cannot find the email with the confirmation link, check your Spam folder. If you still can’t find it, and want to receive another copy, go to your Account Settings, click the Email tab, and follow the instructions there. Please note that it may take up to an hour for the email to arrive.

Para transitar para «Scratchador», deve criar e partilhar projectos, comentar de forma construtiva projectos de outros Scratchadores e ser paciente! Assim que tiver cumprido os requisitos, surgirá uma ligação na sua página de perfil convidando-o a tornar-se um Scratchador, e ficará com novas capacidades no sítio web do Scratch. (Note que não promovemos Novos Scratchadores a Scratchadores por pedido.)","faq.multipleAccountTitle":"Posso ter mais do que uma conta?","faq.multipleAccountBody":"It's fine to have a few accounts on the Scratch website, as long as none of them are used to break the {cgLink}. In that case, all related accounts may be blocked or deleted.","faq.multipleLoginTitle":"É OK haver mais do que uma pessoa autenticada numa mesma conta?","faq.multipleLoginBody":"This is not allowed because the website and project editor can easily get confused when more than one person is logged in to the same account. When an account does something that violates the {cgLink}, all related accounts may be blocked or deleted. If you share an account with someone who does something bad with it, this means your accounts can be blocked for what the other person did.","faq.changeUsernameTitle":"Posso alterar o meu nome de utilizador?","faq.changeUsernameBody":"A estrutura do sítio web do Scratch depende da existência de nomes de utilizador coerentes, pelo que não é possível alterar o seu nome de utilizador. Se deseja mesmo mudar para um outro nome de utilizador, pode criar uma nova conta, mas terá de ser você a copiar os seus projectos para a nova conta.","faq.shareInfoTitle":"Que informação posso partilhar na / com a minha conta?","faq.shareInfoBody":"Por favor não partilhe informação pessoal de contacto, tal como a sua morada física, o seu endereço de correio electrónico, o seu número de telefone ou qualquer outra informação que possa ser usada para estabelecer contacto consigo fora do sítio web do Scratch.

Be sure to include as much detail as you can, with links to relevant pages.","faq.noFlameTitle":"O que fazer se vir alguém sendo maldoso ou desrespeitoso?","faq.noFlameBody":"Não alimente a discussão! Responder a comentários maldosos com mais comentários maldosos só piora a situação, e poderá resultar no bloqueio da sua conta. Em vez de o fazer, limite-se a reportar o que quer que seja desrespeitoso ou não construtivo, e nós seguiremos a partir daí com o autor. Verificamos o que nos é reportado todos os dias, várias vezes por dia - pode estar certo de que resolveremos o problema.","faq.reviewContentTitle":"O que faz a equipa do Scratch quando algo é reportado ou assinalado?","faq.reviewContentBody":"The Scratch Team reviews reported comments and projects every day. If something breaks the Scratch {cgLink}, we will remove it and send a warning to the account. We may also block the accounts or networks that were used to share it, depending on what was shared and if the person has been sent warnings before","faq.blockedAccountTitle":"O que acontece quando uma conta é bloqueada?","faq.blockedAccountBody":"When an account is blocked, the owner can no longer access their account, use it to create projects, or post new comments. When they login, they see a page that explains why the account was blocked, along with a web form they can use to request to be unblocked. If the owner can show that they understand why their account was blocked, and promises to follow the Scratch {cgLink} in the future, they will be unblocked.","faq.stolenAccountTitle":"Alguém conseguiu acesso à minha conta e levou ao bloqueio da minha conta. Que devo fazer?","faq.stolenAccountBody":"You are responsible for keeping your password secure. If someone you know took control of your account and did bad things, tell the adults in charge of the computer they used. If you think someone you don’t know has access to your account, change the password and / or use the {contactLink} link to explain the situation. If your account was blocked for doing something that you did which broke the Scratch {cgLink}, please don’t tell us that someone else did it. When people tell us someone else used their account to do something bad, we then need to try and talk to that person before we can restore the account. This means your account will just stay blocked for a lot longer than if you are honest with us about what happened.","faq.aboutExtensionsTitle":"O que são extensões?","faq.aboutExtensionsBody":"No editor Scratch, pode adicionar colecções de blocos extra chamadas «extensões». Por exemplo, há extensões que lhe permitem programar dispositivos físicos (tais como o micro:bit ou kits de robótica da LEGO) e que lhe permitem traduzir texto dentro dos seus projectos Scratch. Continuaremos a adicionar novas extensões ao longo do tempo, para poder fazer sempre mais com o Scratch.","faq.howToAddExtensionsTitle":"Como adiciono uma extensão a um projecto?","faq.howToAddExtensionsBody":"If you click on the \"Extensions\" button in the bottom left corner of the Scratch programming editor, you will see a listing of all Scratch Extensions. When you select one of the extensions, a new category of blocks will be added to your project. The extension will be automatically loaded each time your project is opened. You can add multiple extensions to the same project.","faq.createExtensionsTitle":"Como posso criar as minhas próprias extensões ao Scratch?","faq.createExtensionsBody":"A Equipa Scratch irá publicar no futuro especificações e linhas de orientação para as extensões. Uma vez disponíveis, poderá submeter extensões à Equipa Scratch para serem consideradas para inclusão na biblioteca oficial de extensões do Scratch 3.0. Disponibilizaremos também linhas de orientação para o desenvolvimento e distribuição de extensões «experimentais», que poderão ser usadas para criar projectos em computadores individuais, mas não poderão ser partilhadas na comunidade em linha do Scratch.","faq.scratchXTitle":"O que acontecerá ao sítio web ScratchX?","faq.scratchXBody":"O sítio web ScratchX (scratchx.org) foi um laboratório de extensões. As extensões criadas para o ScratchX não são compatíveis com o Scratch 3.0.

If people \"see inside\" or remix your code, it creates a copy of the variable and does not affect or change the original variable.","faq.newScratcherCloudTitle":"Estou autenticado, mas não posso usar projectos com variáveis de nuvem. O que se passa?","faq.newScratcherCloudBody":"Se ainda for um «Novo Scratchador» no sítio web, não poderá usar projectos com variáveis de nuvem. Tem de se ter tornado um «Scratchador» para ter acesso a variáveis de nuvem. Ver a secção Contas (acima) para mais informação sobre a passagem de «Novo Scratchador» a «Scratchador».","faq.multiplayerTitle":"É possível fazer jogos multijogador com variáveis de nuvem?","faq.multiplayerBody":"Jogos multijogador podem ser difíceis de criar, devido à velocidade da rede e a questões de sincronização. No entanto, alguns Scratchadores têm engendrado formas criativas de usar as variáveis de nuvem em jogos que se jogam à vez e noutros tipos de jogos.","faq.schoolsTitle":"O Scratch nas Escolas","faq.howTitle":"Como é que as escolas usam o Scratch?","faq.howBody":"Scratch is used in hundreds of thousands of schools around the world, in many different subject areas (including language arts, science, history, math, and computer science).

In that case, all related accounts may be blocked or deleted.","faq.multipleLoginTitle":"Да ли је уреду да више особа буде пријављено на исти налог?","faq.multipleLoginBody":"This is not allowed because the website and project editor can easily get confused when more than one person is logged in to the same account. When an account does something that violates the {cgLink}, all related accounts may be blocked or deleted. If you share an account with someone who does something bad with it, this means your accounts can be blocked for what the other person did.","faq.changeUsernameTitle":"Могу ли да променим своје име за пријаву?","faq.changeUsernameBody":"The structure of the Scratch website depends on having a consistent account name, so it’s not possible to change your username. If you really need to switch to a new username, you can make a new account, but you'll have to copy your projects over to the new account on your own.","faq.shareInfoTitle":"Које информације могу да делим са / путем мог налога?","faq.shareInfoBody":"Please don’t share personal contact information, such as your physical address, email, phone number, or anything else that can be used to make contact outside of the Scratch website.

Responding to mean comments with more mean comments just makes things worse, and could result in your account being blocked.

If your account was blocked for doing something that you did which broke the Scratch {cgLink}, please don’t tell us that someone else did it.

Todos os projetos compartilhados no site do Scratch são têm licença \"Creative Commons Share Alike\" - Atribuição - NãoComercial - Compartilha Igual-, o que significa que você pode remixar qualquer projeto que você vê no site do Scratch - e todos podem remixar qualquer projeto que você compartilha no site. ","faq.creativeCommonsTitle":"E se eu não quiser que outras pessoas façam remixagens de meus projetos?","faq.creativeCommonsBody":"Remixagem é uma parte importante da comunidade Scratch.

Mas você precisa de um cadastro para salvar e compartilhar seus projetos, escrever comentários e postagens no fórum, e participar em outras atividades sociais na comunidade (como \"gostar\" de projetos de outras pessoas).","faq.createAccountTitle":"Como posso criar uma conta?","faq.createAccountBody":"Just click \"Join\" on the Scratch home page. You’ll need to respond to a few questions, and provide an email address. It takes just a couple minutes, and it’s totally free!","faq.checkConfirmedTitle":"Como posso ver se minha conta foi confirmada?","faq.howToConfirmTitle":"Como faço para confirmar minha conta?","faq.howToConfirmBody":"After you create a new account on Scratch, you’ll receive an email message with a link. Just click the link to confirm your account. Once you confirm your account, you’ll be able to share projects, write comments, and create studios. Confirming your account also lets you receive email updates from the Scratch Team. If you cannot find the email with the confirmation link, check your Spam folder. If you still can’t find it, and want to receive another copy, go to your Account Settings, click the Email tab, and follow the instructions there.

Confirmed email addresses will show a small green checkmark. Otherwise, you will see the text \"Your email address is unconfirmed\" in orange.","faq.settingsLinkText":"Email Settings","faq.requireConfirmTitle":"Eu preciso confirmar minha conta?","faq.requireConfirmBody":"Você ainda pode usar muitas funcionalidades do Scratch sem confirmar sua conta, incluindo criar e salvar projetos (sem compartilhá-los).","faq.forgotPasswordTitle":"Esqueci me meu nome de usuário e senha. Como posso refazê-los?","faq.forgotPasswordBody":"Enter your username or email address on the {resetLink} page.

(Note que não promovemos Novos Scratcher's à Scratcher a pedido)","faq.multipleAccountTitle":"Posso ter mais de uma conta?","faq.multipleAccountBody":"It's fine to have a few accounts on the Scratch website, as long as none of them are used to break the {cgLink}. In that case, all related accounts may be blocked or deleted.","faq.multipleLoginTitle":"Posso ter mais de uma pessoa conectada em uma mesma conta?","faq.multipleLoginBody":"This is not allowed because the website and project editor can easily get confused when more than one person is logged in to the same account. When an account does something that violates the {cgLink}, all related accounts may be blocked or deleted. If you share an account with someone who does something bad with it, this means your accounts can be blocked for what the other person did.","faq.changeUsernameTitle":"Posso mudar meu nome de usuário?","faq.changeUsernameBody":"A estrutura do website do Scratch depende de um nome de conta consistente, por isso não é possível alterar seu nome de usuário. Se você realmente precisar mudar seu nome de usuário, poderá criar uma nova conta, mas precisará copiar seus projetos para a nova conta por conta própria.","faq.shareInfoTitle":"Quais informações posso compartilhar em minha conta?","faq.shareInfoBody":"Por favor, não compartilhe informações pessoais de contato, como seu endereço físico, email, número de telefone ou qualquer outra coisa que possa ser usada para fazer contato fora do site do Scratch.

Be sure to include as much detail as you can, with links to relevant pages.","faq.noFlameTitle":"O que eu faço se vir alguém sendo rude ou desrespeitoso?","faq.noFlameBody":"Não alimente a discussão! Responder a comentários maldosos com mais comentários maldosos só piora a situação, e poderá resultar no bloqueio de sua conta. Em vez disso, limite-se a denunciar o que quer que seja desrespeitoso ou não construtivo, e nós seguiremos a partir daí com o autor. Verificamos o que nos é denunciado todos os dias, várias vezes por dia - pode estar certo de que resolveremos o problema.","faq.reviewContentTitle":"O que a equipe do Scratch faz quando algo é denunciado ou sinalizado?","faq.reviewContentBody":"The Scratch Team reviews reported comments and projects every day. If something breaks the Scratch {cgLink}, we will remove it and send a warning to the account. We may also block the accounts or networks that were used to share it, depending on what was shared and if the person has been sent warnings before","faq.blockedAccountTitle":"O que acontece quando uma conta é bloqueada?","faq.blockedAccountBody":"When an account is blocked, the owner can no longer access their account, use it to create projects, or post new comments. When they login, they see a page that explains why the account was blocked, along with a web form they can use to request to be unblocked. If the owner can show that they understand why their account was blocked, and promises to follow the Scratch {cgLink} in the future, they will be unblocked.","faq.stolenAccountTitle":"Alguém teve acesso a minha conta e tive minha conta bloqueada. O que devo fazer?","faq.stolenAccountBody":"You are responsible for keeping your password secure. If someone you know took control of your account and did bad things, tell the adults in charge of the computer they used. If you think someone you don’t know has access to your account, change the password and / or use the {contactLink} link to explain the situation. If your account was blocked for doing something that you did which broke the Scratch {cgLink}, please don’t tell us that someone else did it. When people tell us someone else used their account to do something bad, we then need to try and talk to that person before we can restore the account. This means your account will just stay blocked for a lot longer than if you are honest with us about what happened.","faq.aboutExtensionsTitle":"O que são extensões?","faq.aboutExtensionsBody":"No editor do Scratch, você pode adicionar coleções de blocos extras chamados \"extensões\". Por exemplo, há extensões que permitem que você programe dispositivos físicos (como kits de micro:bits e de robótica LEGO) e traduza textos em seus projetos do Scratch. Continuaremos adicionando novas extensões, então o que você pode fazer com o Scratch continuará a crescer ao longo do tempo.","faq.howToAddExtensionsTitle":"Como eu adiciono uma extensão a um projeto?","faq.howToAddExtensionsBody":"If you click on the \"Extensions\" button in the bottom left corner of the Scratch programming editor, you will see a listing of all Scratch Extensions.

You can add multiple extensions to the same project.","faq.createExtensionsTitle":"Como eu crio minha própria extensão para o Scratch?","faq.createExtensionsBody":"A Equipe Scratch estará publicando especificações e diretrizes para extensões no futuro. Uma vez disponível, você poderá enviar extensões para a Equipe Scratch para consideração na biblioteca oficial de extensões do Scratch 3.0. Também forneceremos diretrizes para o desenvolvimento e a distribuição de extensões \"experimentais\", que podem ser usadas para criar projetos em computadores individuais, mas não compartilhadas na comunidade online do Scratch.","faq.scratchXTitle":"O que acontecerá com o site do ScratchX?","faq.scratchXBody":"O site ScratchX (scratchx.org) foi um teste experimental para extensões. Extensões criadas para o ScratchX não são compatíveis com o Scratch 3.0.

If people \"see inside\" or remix your code, it creates a copy of the variable and does not affect or change the original variable.","faq.newScratcherCloudTitle":"Estou logado, mas não consigo usar projetos com variáveis em nuvem. O que está acontecendo?","faq.newScratcherCloudBody":"Se você ainda for um \"Novo Scratcher\" no site, não poderá usar projetos com variáveis ​​de nuvem.

Through remixing, creative ideas spread through the Scratch community, and everyone benefits. All projects shared on the Scratch website are covered by the “Creative Commons Share Alike” license, which means that you can remix any project you see on the Scratch website -- and everyone else can remix any of the projects that you share on the website.","faq.creativeCommonsTitle":"Что если я не хочу, чтобы другие делали ремиксы моих проектов?","faq.creativeCommonsBody":"Remixing is an important part of the Scratch community.

In that case, all related accounts may be blocked or deleted.","faq.multipleLoginTitle":"Нормально ли если несколько людей входят один и тот же аккаут?","faq.multipleLoginBody":"This is not allowed because the website and project editor can easily get confused when more than one person is logged in to the same account. When an account does something that violates the {cgLink}, all related accounts may be blocked or deleted. If you share an account with someone who does something bad with it, this means your accounts can be blocked for what the other person did.","faq.changeUsernameTitle":"Могу ли изменить мое имя участника?","faq.changeUsernameBody":"The structure of the Scratch website depends on having a consistent account name, so it’s not possible to change your username. If you really need to switch to a new username, you can make a new account, but you'll have to copy your projects over to the new account on your own.","faq.shareInfoTitle":"Какую информацию я могу публиковать в моём аккаунте?","faq.shareInfoBody":"Please don’t share personal contact information, such as your physical address, email, phone number, or anything else that can be used to make contact outside of the Scratch website.

We may also block the accounts or networks that were used to share it, depending on what was shared and if the person has been sent warnings before","faq.blockedAccountTitle":"Что происходит, когда аккаунт заблокирован?","faq.blockedAccountBody":"When an account is blocked, the owner can no longer access their account, use it to create projects, or post new comments. When they login, they see a page that explains why the account was blocked, along with a web form they can use to request to be unblocked. If the owner can show that they understand why their account was blocked, and promises to follow the Scratch {cgLink} in the future, they will be unblocked.","faq.stolenAccountTitle":"Someone got access to my account and got my account blocked. What do I do?","faq.stolenAccountBody":"You are responsible for keeping your password secure. If someone you know took control of your account and did bad things, tell the adults in charge of the computer they used. If you think someone you don’t know has access to your account, change the password and / or use the {contactLink} link to explain the situation. If your account was blocked for doing something that you did which broke the Scratch {cgLink}, please don’t tell us that someone else did it. When people tell us someone else used their account to do something bad, we then need to try and talk to that person before we can restore the account. This means your account will just stay blocked for a lot longer than if you are honest with us about what happened.","faq.aboutExtensionsTitle":"What are extensions?","faq.aboutExtensionsBody":"In the Scratch editor, you can add collections of extra blocks called \"extensions.\" For example, there are extensions that enable you to program physical devices (such as micro:bit and LEGO robotics kits) and to translate text within your Scratch projects. We will continue to add new extensions over time, so what you can do with Scratch will continue to grow over time. ","faq.howToAddExtensionsTitle":"How do I add an extension to a project?","faq.howToAddExtensionsBody":"If you click on the \"Extensions\" button in the bottom left corner of the Scratch programming editor, you will see a listing of all Scratch Extensions.

You can add multiple extensions to the same project.","faq.createExtensionsTitle":"How do I create my own extension for Scratch","faq.createExtensionsBody":"The Scratch Team will be publishing specifications and guidelines for extensions in the future. Once available, you will be able to submit extensions to the Scratch Team for consideration in the official Scratch 3.0 extensions library. We’ll also provide guidelines for developing and distributing \"experimental\" extensions, which can be used to create projects on individual computers, but not shared in the Scratch online community.","faq.scratchXTitle":"What will happen to the ScratchX website?","faq.scratchXBody":"The ScratchX website (scratchx.org) was an experimental testbed for extensions.

In that case, all related accounts may be blocked or deleted.","faq.multipleLoginTitle":"Це нормально, щоб більше, ніж одна людина могла використовувати обліковий запис?","faq.multipleLoginBody":"This is not allowed because the website and project editor can easily get confused when more than one person is logged in to the same account. When an account does something that violates the {cgLink}, all related accounts may be blocked or deleted. If you share an account with someone who does something bad with it, this means your accounts can be blocked for what the other person did.","faq.changeUsernameTitle":"Як я можу змінити ім’я користувача?","faq.changeUsernameBody":"The structure of the Scratch website depends on having a consistent account name, so it’s not possible to change your username. If you really need to switch to a new username, you can make a new account, but you'll have to copy your projects over to the new account on your own.","faq.shareInfoTitle":"Якою інформацією я можу поділитися з мого облікового запису?","faq.shareInfoBody":"Please don’t share personal contact information, such as your physical address, email, phone number, or anything else that can be used to make contact outside of the Scratch website.

Ми перевіряємо звіти щодня, кілька разів на день - так що будьте впевнені, ми вирішимо це питання.","faq.reviewContentTitle":"Що команда Скретчу робить, коли щось їм повідомляють?","faq.reviewContentBody":"The Scratch Team reviews reported comments and projects every day. If something breaks the Scratch {cgLink}, we will remove it and send a warning to the account. We may also block the accounts or networks that were used to share it, depending on what was shared and if the person has been sent warnings before","faq.blockedAccountTitle":"Що робити коли обліковий запис заблоковано?","faq.blockedAccountBody":"When an account is blocked, the owner can no longer access their account, use it to create projects, or post new comments. When they login, they see a page that explains why the account was blocked, along with a web form they can use to request to be unblocked.

What do I do?","faq.stolenAccountBody":"You are responsible for keeping your password secure. If someone you know took control of your account and did bad things, tell the adults in charge of the computer they used. If you think someone you don’t know has access to your account, change the password and / or use the {contactLink} link to explain the situation. If your account was blocked for doing something that you did which broke the Scratch {cgLink}, please don’t tell us that someone else did it. When people tell us someone else used their account to do something bad, we then need to try and talk to that person before we can restore the account. This means your account will just stay blocked for a lot longer than if you are honest with us about what happened.","faq.aboutExtensionsTitle":"What are extensions?","faq.aboutExtensionsBody":"In the Scratch editor, you can add collections of extra blocks called \"extensions.\" For example, there are extensions that enable you to program physical devices (such as micro:bit and LEGO robotics kits) and to translate text within your Scratch projects.

In that case, all related accounts may be blocked or deleted.","faq.multipleLoginTitle":"Liệu có thể nhiều người cùng đăng nhập vào một tài khoản được không?","faq.multipleLoginBody":"This is not allowed because the website and project editor can easily get confused when more than one person is logged in to the same account. When an account does something that violates the {cgLink}, all related accounts may be blocked or deleted. If you share an account with someone who does something bad with it, this means your accounts can be blocked for what the other person did.","faq.changeUsernameTitle":"Tôi có thể thay đổi tên người dùng được không?","faq.changeUsernameBody":"The structure of the Scratch website depends on having a consistent account name, so it’s not possible to change your username. If you really need to switch to a new username, you can make a new account, but you'll have to copy your projects over to the new account on your own.","faq.shareInfoTitle":"Tôi có thể chia sẻ thông tin gì trên / bằng tài khoản của tôi?","faq.shareInfoBody":"Please don’t share personal contact information, such as your physical address, email, phone number, or anything else that can be used to make contact outside of the Scratch website. Please report projects, comments, or forum posts that contain this kind of information, so the Scratch Team can remove the information, and remind the author of our policy against sharing personal contact information.","faq.deleteAccountTitle":"Làm thế nào để xóa tài khoản?","faq.deleteAccountBody":"Login to Scratch, and then click your username in the top right-hand corner.
